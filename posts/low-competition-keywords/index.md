## What are Low Competition Keywords?

Low competition keywords are phrases that have a low level of competition among websites. These keywords are typically easier to rank for on search engines like Google, as there are fewer businesses trying to rank for them. This means that if you can successfully rank for low competition keywords, you may be able to attract more traffic to your website and increase your chances of making sales.

## How to do Keyword Competition Analysis?

Keyword competition analysis is an important step in developing an effective SEO strategy. Here are the steps to perform a keyword competition analysis:

1. **Identify your target keywords**: 

Choose a list of keywords that are relevant to your website's content and that you want to rank for in search engines.

2. **Analyze search engine results**: 

Perform a search for each of your target keywords and analyze the top-ranking results. Look at factors like domain authority, page authority, backlinks, content quality, and other ranking factors.

3. **Use a keyword research tool**: 

Use a keyword research tool like Google Keyword Planner, Ahrefs, SEMrush, or Moz to analyze your target keywords. Look for information on search volume, competition level, and other relevant metrics.

4. **Identify competitor keywords**: 

Identify your top competitors in your niche and analyze the keywords they are targeting. This can provide insights into potential keywords that you may have missed.

5. **Calculate keyword difficulty**: 

Use a keyword difficulty tool like Ahrefs or Moz to calculate the difficulty level for each of your target keywords. This can provide insights into which keywords will be easier or harder to rank for.

6. **Create an action plan**: 

Based on your analysis, create an action plan for optimizing your website's content for your target keywords. This can include creating high-quality content, building backlinks, optimizing on-page elements like title tags and meta descriptions, and other SEO strategies.

By performing a keyword competition analysis, you can gain valuable insights into your target keywords and develop an effective SEO strategy that will help you improve your search engine ranking over time.

## What is Keyword Competition Score?

Keyword competition score, also known as keyword difficulty score, is a metric used to measure the level of competition for a specific keyword in search engine results pages (SERPs). It's a relative score that ranges from 0 to 100 and is calculated based on various factors such as the number of websites targeting the keyword, the quality of their content and backlinks, and the strength of their domain authority.

A high keyword competition score indicates that it will be more difficult to rank for a particular keyword in search engine results. Conversely, a low keyword competition score suggests that it may be easier to rank for that keyword.

Keyword competition score is an important metric to consider when conducting keyword research for SEO purposes. It helps you identify which keywords to target and prioritize based on their potential to drive traffic to your website and the level of effort required to achieve higher search engine rankings.

Various tools like SEMrush, Ahrefs, and Moz provide keyword competition score metrics to assist in keyword research and planning. By paying attention to the keyword competition score and incorporating it into your SEO strategy, you can improve your chances of ranking higher in search engines and attract more organic traffic to your website.

[Moz Keyword Explorer](https://moz.com/explorer) is a paid keyword research tool that provides information on keyword difficulty, search volume, and related keywords. It also provides information on the organic click-through rate (CTR) for each keyword, which can help you understand how many clicks you can expect to receive if you rank for a particular keyword.


When using these tools, it's important to keep in mind that keyword competition is just one factor to consider. You should also consider the relevance of the keyword to your business, the search volume, and the intent of the person searching for the keyword. By taking these factors into account, you can find the best keywords to target for your business.

Another way to find low competition keywords is to look for long-tail keywords. Long-tail keywords are phrases that are more specific and targeted than shorter, more general keywords. Because they are more specific, they tend to have lower competition and can be easier to rank for. For example, instead of targeting the keyword "shoes," you might target the long-tail keyword "women's running shoes for flat feet."

## Other Factors that can Affect Keyword's Competition

While competition level is an important factor to consider when selecting keywords, it's not the only factor that can affect your website's ranking on search engines. Here are a few other factors to consider:

- **Search volume:**

A keyword may have low competition, but if nobody is searching for it, it may not be worth targeting.

- **Relevance:**

Your keywords should be relevant to your business and the content on your website. If you target irrelevant keywords, your bounce rate may increase, which can negatively impact your ranking on search engines.

- **User intent:**

Consider the intent of the person searching for the keyword. Are they looking for information or are they ready to make a purchase? Understanding user intent can help you create content that meets their needs and increases the chances of them converting.

## Should You Avoid High-competition Keywords?
While it's important to target low competition keywords, that doesn't mean you should avoid high-competition keywords altogether. High-competition keywords often have a higher search volume, which means there is more potential traffic to be gained from ranking for those keywords. Additionally, high-competition keywords may be more relevant to your business, and therefore may be worth the effort to rank for.

However, it's important to have realistic expectations when targeting high-competition keywords. Ranking for these keywords may require more time and effort, and you may not see results immediately. Additionally, you may need to invest in paid advertising to compete with other businesses for those keywords.

In conclusion, finding low competition keywords is an important part of any digital marketing strategy. By using keyword research tools and targeting long-tail keywords, you can increase your chances of ranking higher on search engines and attracting more traffic to your website. However, it's important to also consider other factors like search volume, relevance, and user intent when selecting keywords. And while it's okay to target high-competition keywords, be prepared for the extra effort and investment required to rank for higher place.
