# When to Use Performance Max vs. Demand Gen?


## What’s the Difference Between Performance Max and Demand Gen Campaigns?

**Performance Max (PMax)** is a fully automated campaign type by Google that allows advertisers to run a single campaign across all Google-owned channels—Search, Display, YouTube, Gmail, Discover, Maps, and more. It serves as a **complement to Search Ads**, helping advertisers reach more potential customers across multiple touchpoints.

**Demand Gen Campaigns**, on the other hand, are designed for visually engaging platforms like YouTube and Google Discover. They focus on **sparking interest and creating demand** through short-form videos and in-feed content—ideal for attracting new audiences to your brand or products.

While both campaign types have their advantages, they differ significantly in areas like placements, funnel stage focus, targeting control, automation, creative handling, and reporting transparency.


## Where Do Performance Max and Demand Gen Ads Appear?

* **PMax Exclusive Channels**: Search, Shopping, Maps – ideal for direct response.
* **Demand Gen Exclusive Channels**: YouTube Shorts, YouTube Feed – designed for immersive, social-like engagement.
* **Shared Channels**: YouTube (long-form), Gmail, Discover – targeting interest-based discovery.

**Think of it this way**:
PMax = *Full Google Network*
Demand Gen = *Short Video + Social Feeds*

## Which Funnel Stages Are Best for Each Campaign Type?

* **Demand Gen** focuses on **Upper to Mid Funnel** (Awareness & Interest). Best for brand storytelling, engagement, and demand creation.
* **Used Together**: Attract audiences with **Demand Gen** on YouTube Shorts/Discover, then retarget or convert via **PMax** across Search or Shopping.

## How Much Audience Control Do You Have?

* **PMax** is highly automated. You can provide “audience signals,” but the system ultimately decides who sees your ads.
* **Demand Gen** gives advertisers more manual control over targeting, including interests, behaviors, custom audiences, and remarketing logic.
