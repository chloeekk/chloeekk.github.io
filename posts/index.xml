<p>I recently noticed an issue with newly published articles: <strong>Google only indexes one language version of the same article (either Chinese or English)</strong>. There are occasional cases where both versions get indexed, but this is rare. I began investigating potential configuration issues, which may include:</p>
<h3 id="multilingual-configuration-issues">Multilingual Configuration Issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ensure proper multilingual configuration in <code>config.toml</code> or <code>config.yaml</code>, e.g.:</li>

<h3 id="missing-hreflang-tags">Missing <code>hreflang</code> Tags</h3>
<p>Search engines require <code>hreflang</code> tags to recognize different language versions. Incorrect implementation may lead to single-language indexing.</p>]]></description>

Predominantly use low-saturation tones (e.g., Morandi color palette) with gentle light-dark contrasts, avoiding high contrast or fluorescent colors.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Protect Hugo Website Content from Being Copied</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>First, it must be clearly understood: There is no technical method that can 100% prevent content from being copied (methods like screenshots, manual rewriting, or crawlers can bypass protections). However, the following methods can significantly increase the difficulty of copying and reduce the risk of bulk theft.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<h2 id="the-first-issue-to-consider-the-positioning-of-the-landing-page-in-the-site">The first issue to consider: the positioning of the landing page in the site</h2>
<p>Considering different business goals, marketing costs and applicable scenarios, there are two forms of landing pages, each with its own advantages and disadvantages:</p>
<h3 id="specially-built-landing-pages">Specially built landing pages</h3>
<ul>
<li>Features:
<ul>
<li>Independent design: customized for specific marketing activities (such as advertising, brand activities, promotions, etc.), consistent with the official website design style, but with more streamlined and focused content</li>
<li>No navigation bar interference: usually choose to hide the global navigation bar at the top, only retain the brand logo and important buttons, avoid users jumping to other pages, and expect to guide users to complete the target conversion actions (such as registration, purchase, etc.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Advantages:
<ul>
<li>High conversion rate: present as much information as possible in a smaller layout, the content accurately matches user needs, reduces interference, and helps to improve conversion rate.</li>
<li>Support fast iteration: because it is a customized page, it has high flexibility in adjusting content and design, and will not affect other businesses.</li>
<li>Easy data analysis: the overall CTA logic of the page is basically consistent, the number of user paths is small, and only a small number of channels use this page, which is convenient for subsequent analysis of data effects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Disadvantages:
<ul>
<li>Requires additional design and development costs.</li>
<li>Weak brand credibility: Users may want to know more about the website, but dedicated landing pages generally do not provide an obvious entrance to other pages.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="existing-pages-on-the-official-website">Existing pages on the official website</h3>
<ul>
<li>Features:
<ul>
<li>Reuse existing content: Directly use a page on the official website (such as the homepage, product page, article page) as the landing page.</li>
<li>Keep the top navigation bar: Users can understand the general structure of the website through the navigation bar and freely jump to the page they are interested in.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Advantages:
<ul>
<li>Cost savings: No additional design and development involved.</li>
<li>Strengthen brand consistency: Ensure the overall experience of users on the official website, and at the same time have user comments, third-party evaluation certificates and other pages as support for brand credibility.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Disadvantages:
<ul>
<li>Relatively low conversion rate: The official website content is more brand-oriented, and the information is not focused enough. Users are easily distracted by other content such as navigation bars and internal links.</li>
<li>Difficult to iterate quickly and data is mixed: Different channels will use official website pages, and content and design adjustments require the consent of multiple parties before they can be promoted. The multiple behavioral paths of users on the website also increase the difficulty of data analysis.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As for which form or website structure is better, it still depends on the brand&rsquo;s own focus and marketing strategy. Take the landing page of monday.com as an example: it is not difficult to find that monday.com uses the official website homepage (<a href="https://monday.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">https://monday.com/</a>) to accept users who search for its brand words, and uses dedicated landing pages (such as <a href="https://monday.com/ap/project-management" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">https://monday.com/ap/project-management</a>) to meet users who search for other keywords (here I use project management).</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>According to Google’s algorithm mechanics, the search results you receive on Google vary based on your geographic location (or the geographic preferences implied in your search terms). For businesses with physical local stores or those offering location-specific services, creating landing pages tailored to specific regions is essential. These pages not only help search engine crawlers better retrieve and understand your content but also enable visitors to quickly grasp what products or services are available near their residence.</p>]]></description>
