Similar automated ad products have also emerged on platforms like Meta and TikTok.</p>
<p>Compared to the traditional keyword-centric approach, AI Max for Search relies more on comprehensive learning from user behavior signals, historical conversion data, and creative assets, with AI autonomously deciding when, to whom, and in what combination to display ads. Simply put, manual control is giving way to &ldquo;signal feeding&rdquo; and &ldquo;model learning.&rdquo;</p>]]></description></item><item><title>When to Use Performance Max vs. Demand Gen?</title><link>https://chloevolution.com/posts/demand-gen-vs-performance-max/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 20:36:25 +0800</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://chloevolution.com/posts/demand-gen-vs-performance-max/</guid><description><![CDATA[<h2 id="whats-the-difference-between-performance-max-and-demand-gen-campaigns">What’s the Difference Between Performance Max and Demand Gen Campaigns?</h2>
<p><strong>Performance Max (PMax)</strong> is a fully automated campaign type by Google that allows advertisers to run a single campaign across all Google-owned channels—Search, Display, YouTube, Gmail, Discover, Maps, and more. It serves as a <strong>complement to Search Ads</strong>, helping advertisers reach more potential customers across multiple touchpoints.</p>
<p><strong>Demand Gen Campaigns</strong>, on the other hand, are designed for visually engaging platforms like YouTube and Google Discover. They focus on <strong>sparking interest and creating demand</strong> through short-form videos and in-feed content—ideal for attracting new audiences to your brand or products.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Do Tariffs Affect PPC Advertising?</title><link>https://chloevolution.com/posts/how-will-the-tariffs-impact-ppc-campaigns/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 09:39:55 +0800</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://chloevolution.com/posts/how-will-the-tariffs-impact-ppc-campaigns/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p><strong>The answer is definitely: Yes.</strong></p>
<p>When new tariffs are imposed or existing ones are expanded, the <strong>fundamental cost structure of goods</strong> changes, and companies&rsquo; bidding behaviors also shift:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some companies will increase their bids to secure the best ad positions, hoping to maintain existing profits.</li>
<li>Some companies will maintain their current bid levels in the short term, but ad spend may still rise (influenced by other advertisers increasing their bids, leading to an overall industry CPC increase). In the short term, they&rsquo;ll choose to absorb costs to maintain market share.</li>
<li>Other companies will choose to exit this new round of competition, shifting their marketing budgets to other channels.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-are-tariffs">What are Tariffs?</h2>
<p>A tariff (Customs Duty) is a mandatory tax levied by a sovereign nation or economic entity on <strong>imported goods</strong> as they cross its customs border. It&rsquo;s one of the most common forms of trade barriers in international trade, enforced and collected by customs agencies.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>FounderPal Review: AI Marketing Tool Hands-On Experience</title><link>https://chloevolution.com/posts/founderpal-review/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 May 2025 11:59:03 +0800</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://chloevolution.com/posts/founderpal-review/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://founderpal.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">FounderPal</a> is an AI-powered marketing platform, somewhat similar to <a href="https://chloevolution.com/posts/swiftbrief-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Swiftbrief</a>, which we previously reviewed.
