# How to Analyze a Stock?


First, stock picking rarely outperforms the market; ordinary investors are better off choosing passive investing.  
But for those who want to research individual stocks themselves, the entire process can be broken down into the following **6 steps**:

![the-reason-for-passive-investment](the-reason-for-passive-investment.png)

## Step 1: Screening for Ideas
This is the process of narrowing the research scope so you don’t waste time on companies you’re not interested in. Use stock screeners to filter companies that meet specific criteria (such as revenue growth, profitability, debt levels, etc.).

Adopt a **bottom-up** strategy, meaning focus on specific companies rather than macroeconomic trends.  
The core of the analysis is answering two questions: **“Is this the best company in its industry?”** and **“Is its price reasonable?”**

### How to Identify Targets and Competitors?
* **Identify the industry:** Use tools like Yahoo Finance to see which **sector** and **industry** the target stock (e.g., Tesla) belongs to.
* **Choose competitors:** Select around 4 competitors of similar size or in the same industry for horizontal comparison (e.g., Toyota, Ford, GM, Nio).

### How to measure revenue growth, profitability, and debt levels?
#### 1. Sales Growth

**Concept and Purpose**
* **What is sales growth?** It measures the percentage increase in revenue over a specific period (typically the past 1 or 3 years).
* **Purpose:** It is the "engine" of a company’s growth. Since all profits originate from sales, strong sales growth usually indicates the company is gaining market share through innovative products or strong brand power. It is the first indicator to determine whether a company has a **competitive advantage**.

**How to Understand It**
* Imagine a popularity contest. If a company’s sales growth significantly exceeds its peers (e.g., Tesla vs. Ford as mentioned in the video), it shows customers are “voting with their feet” and switching to the company’s products.
* **Combine short-term and long-term:** Usually analyze both 1-year growth (recent momentum) and 3-year growth (sustained strength).  
  If 3-year growth is fast but 1-year growth suddenly slows, it may signal a potential trend reversal.
* **Meaning of high growth:** High growth rates (e.g., >20%) often correspond to growth stocks, and the market is willing to assign higher valuations.  
  Low growth (e.g., <5%) often corresponds to mature or stagnant companies.
* **Formula:**  
  $
  Sales\ Growth = \frac{Current\ Revenue - Previous\ Revenue}{Previous\ Revenue} \times 100\%
  $

#### 2. 10-Year Revenue CAGR

**Concept and Purpose**
* **What is CAGR?** Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) measures the average annual growth rate over a given period (here, 10 years).
* **Purpose:** Revenue is the lifeline of a company. Using 10-year data helps **smooth out** short-term fluctuations or one-time events, revealing the company’s long-term and sustainable growth trends.

**How to Understand It**
* Imagine a company’s revenue rising and falling over 10 years. CAGR is like calculating the **average speed** over this 10-year journey.
* If the CAGR is high (e.g., above 10%), it means the company has maintained strong expansion over the past decade.
* **Formula:**  
  $
  CAGR = \left(\frac{Ending\ Revenue}{Beginning\ Revenue}\right)^{1/10} - 1
  $

#### 2. Operating Profit Margin

**Concept and Purpose**
* **What is operating profit?** Operating Profit is what a company earns from its core business activities, **after deducting** all operating expenses like cost of sales, employee salaries, rent, utilities, etc., but **before deducting** interest and taxes.
* **Purpose:** It measures the **efficiency and profitability** of the company’s core business. It shows how much profit is left from each \$1 of sales to pay for debt and taxes.

**How to Understand It**
* If a restaurant sells **\$100** worth of food and, after deducting ingredient costs, chef wages, and rent, it has **\$15** left, its operating margin is 15%.
* **Higher margins** mean strong pricing power or efficient cost control. For investors, this indicates a healthier “money-making machine.”
* **Formula:**  
  $
  Operating\ Margin = \frac{Operating\ Profit}{Revenue} \times 100\%
  $

#### 3. Net Debt/EBITDA

**Concept and Purpose**
* **What is EBITDA?** **EBITDA** (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) approximates a company’s **operating cash flow**. It can be understood as the cash generated by core business activities before accounting adjustments (like depreciation) and financing costs (like interest).
* **What is net debt?** **Net Debt** is total debt minus cash and cash equivalents.
* **Purpose:** It measures a company’s **debt-repayment ability and financial risk**. It shows how many years of EBITDA are needed to repay net debt.

**How to Understand It**
* Imagine you owe the bank **\$300k** (net debt) and generate **\$100k** of operating income each year (EBITDA).
* Your **Net Debt/EBITDA** is:  
  $
  300k / 100k = 3
  $
* This means you need **3 years** to repay all your debt.
* **Lower values are safer.** Below 3–4× is generally healthy (industry-specific). Higher ratios indicate elevated leverage and risk.
* **Formula:**  
  $
  Net\ Debt/EBITDA = \frac{Total\ Debt - Cash}{EBITDA}
  $

### What are the core standards for measuring these three indicators? Is there a unified benchmark?

For these three indicators, the answer is: **there is no absolute, universally authoritative benchmark.**

In fundamental analysis, the value of these indicators lies mainly in **comparison** and **industry context**.

You should evaluate them based on two approaches:

**1. Historical Comparison**  
Compare the company’s current indicators to its 5- or 10-year historical averages.
* **Question:** Is the company healthier or more dangerous than it used to be?
* **Example:** If a company’s historical Net Debt/EBITDA is 2× but now jumps to 5×, it is a **warning signal**, regardless of the industry average.

**2. Peer/Industry Comparison**  
Compare the company’s metrics to its direct competitors or industry averages.
* **Question:** Is the company leading, average, or lagging in profitability or risk level?
* **Example:** Software companies may have a 25% operating margin, but retail chains may only have 5%. Using 25% to judge retail is unreasonable — the comparison must be within the same industry.

Although there are no absolute standards, here are commonly referenced ranges:

| Metric | Common Reference Ranges & Context |
| :--- | :--- |
| **10-Year Revenue CAGR** | **Higher is better, but must match company type.** High-growth tech firms may need >15%; mature utility companies may consider 5% good. The key is whether the company is “doing what it should be doing.” |
| **Operating Margin** | **Must be compared with industry averages.** Higher margins often indicate a “moat.” If a company consistently has higher margins than peers, it likely has stronger cost control or pricing power. |
| **Net Debt/EBITDA** | **Lower is better for assessing risk.** Most non-financial, non-utility companies aim for **<3–4×**. If >5×, unless cash flows are extremely stable, this is considered high financial risk. |



## Step 2: Understanding the Business
This step is mainly **qualitative analysis**, approaching the company as if you were its owner.
* **Core questions:** How does the company make money? Is the revenue recurring or seasonal? Who are its customers, suppliers, and competitors?
* **Sources:** Read the annual report (10-K), quarterly report (10-Q), investor relations page, and Form 8-K (material event filings).
* **SWOT Analysis:** Use the SWOT framework (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) to organize notes.
* **Goal:** Identify companies with **competitive advantages (moats)** and attractive business models.

### Common Business Information Sources
These include regulatory filings (SEC filings) and company-provided information.

Annual reports (10-K), quarterly reports (10-Q), and Form 8-K are official documents required by regulators such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

#### 1. Annual Report (10-K)
The most comprehensive yearly report, like the company’s “yearbook.”  
It contains audited financial statements and detailed discussions on business operations, industry competition, management, and major risks.  
It is essential reading for fundamental research.

#### 2. Quarterly Report (10-Q)
Filed three times a year between annual reports.  
Provides unaudited financials and management discussions about recent quarterly performance.  
It is the key source for understanding the latest company developments.

#### 3. Form 8-K (Material Event Filing)
An emergency filing submitted whenever a major event occurs that may significantly impact stock price.  
Common 8-K events include major acquisitions or disposals, management changes, bankruptcy announcements, or important legal judgments.

#### 4. Investor Relations Page
The section of the company’s official website dedicated to investors.  
It aggregates all relevant documents including 10-K, 10-Q, press releases, investor presentations, and earnings call transcripts.



## Step 3: Understanding the Finances
This step dives into **quantitative analysis**, focusing on the three financial statements: income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement.
* **Key metrics:** Compute long-term (5/10/15-year) CAGR, analyze margins, debt capacity, and liquidity ratios.
* **Peer comparison:** Compare the company with its industry competitors.
* **Forensic analysis (detecting red flags):** Check related-party transactions, executive compensation, and potential accounting manipulation.  
  Be cautious when management emphasizes **“Adjusted”** numbers — they often exclude costs to make performance appear better.

### The Three Financial Statements

#### 1. Income Statement
* **Purpose:** Reports financial performance over a **specific period**, showing profit or loss.
* **Key items:** Revenue, costs, expenses, and **Net Income**.

#### 2. Balance Sheet
* **Purpose:** Reports the company’s financial position at a **specific point in time**, like a snapshot.
* **Key items:** Follows the basic equation  
  **Assets = Liabilities + Equity**,  
  showing what the company owns, owes, and the remaining value for shareholders.

#### 3. Cash Flow Statement
* **Purpose:** Reports the inflow and outflow of cash over a **specific period**.  
  It verifies the company’s ability to produce real cash, since accounting profits alone can be misleading.

### Three Key Components of the Cash Flow Statement

#### 1. Cash Generated from Operations
* **Definition:** Cash flow from **core business operations**, including cash received from sales and cash paid to suppliers and employees.
* This metric is often the most important indicator of corporate health.

#### 2. Cash Invested into Business
* **Definition:** Cash used to purchase or sell long-term assets.
* **Content:** Mainly **Capital Expenditure (CapEx)** such as buying plants or equipment — signals investment in future growth.

#### 3. Cash to/from Investors & Debtors
* **Definition:** Cash transactions between the company and its **owners (shareholders)** or **creditors (banks/bondholders)**.
* **Content:** Includes raising new debt, repaying debt, issuing shares, share buybacks, and dividends.



## Step 4: Understanding the Strategy
Here the focus shifts from historical data to the future.
* **Future plans:** Management priorities, planned capital expenditures (CapEx), and financing decisions (debt vs equity).
* **Track record:** Evaluate whether management delivered on past commitments by reviewing ROI/ROIC.
* **Sources:** Earnings call transcripts and investor presentations are the best materials for strategy analysis.

The core question here is:  
**“Is management good at using the capital investors give them?”**

### 1. Evaluation Time Frames (5-/10-/15-year Rolling Average)

* **Rolling Average:** Not just a single year, but the average of the past 5, 10, or 15 years.
* **Purpose:** To eliminate short-term fluctuations and business cycles, ensuring strong performance is due to sustainable capability and competitive advantages.

### 2. RoX Metrics (Return-on-Capital Measures)

These metrics measure how efficiently the company generates profit from its capital — essential for assessing business quality and economic moats.

#### Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)
* **Measures:** All capital used in operations (both debt and equity).
* **Purpose:** Evaluates how efficiently total capital is used to generate profits.  
  High ROCE means strong operational efficiency.

#### Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)
* **Measures:** All long-term capital (debt + equity).
* **Purpose:** **One of the best indicators of management quality.**  
  If ROIC consistently exceeds the company’s cost of capital, it is creating long-term value.

#### Return on Equity (ROE)
* **Measures:** Only shareholder equity.
* **Purpose:** Shows how efficiently shareholder money generates profits.  
  But ROE can be inflated by high debt, so it must be reviewed together with ROCE/ROIC.



## Step 5: Valuation
This step is placed later to avoid price bias interfering with quality assessment.
* **Relative valuation:** Check P/E, EV/EBITDA, compare with history and peers.
* **Absolute valuation:** Occasionally use DCF to forecast future cash flows and discount them to present value.
* **Decisions:**
  * If the price is reasonable — buy.
  * If it's a great company but too expensive — put it on the **Watch List** and wait for corrections or market panic.



## Step 6: Portfolio Analysis (Risk Management)
Even with great stocks, a poorly structured portfolio still loses money.  
You must periodically review two dimensions:

**1. Asset Allocation**
* **Check:** How much capital is in stocks, bonds, real estate, crypto, etc.?
* **Principle:** Different assets respond differently to macro environments.  
  For example, when stocks fall, bonds often rise.
* **Suggestion:** Even young investors should hold at least **10% in bonds** or real estate to balance equity risk.

**2. Sector Allocation**
* **Check:** Are your holdings concentrated in a single sector (e.g., all tech stocks)?
* **Principle:** Different sectors behave differently in market crashes.  
  During 2008, consumer staples fell much less than the overall market.
* **Suggestion:** A portfolio should cover **at least 4–5 major economic sectors** (healthcare, tech, consumer, utilities, etc.) to avoid major drawdowns from one sector’s downturn.
