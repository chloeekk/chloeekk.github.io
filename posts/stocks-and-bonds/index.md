# Stocks and Bonds


You may have heard that the key to successful investing lies in “picking the right stocks” or “catching the next big trend.” In reality, however, there is a more fundamental and more powerful determinant in the financial world: **how you allocate your capital**.

Put simply, the majority of variation in investment returns does not depend on whether you bought Alibaba or Tencent. Instead, it depends on which **asset class** you choose to allocate your money to—high-risk, high-return **stocks**, lower-risk **bonds** that provide stable income, or simply holding cash.

This allocation ratio is what we commonly refer to as **asset allocation**.

Stocks and bonds are the two core pillars of any investment portfolio. They are not only tools for generating returns, but also key forces that constrain and influence each other. Understanding their respective nature—and, more importantly, how they interact—allows you to better:

1. **Interpret the market:** Why do bond prices fall when stock markets surge? Why does news of interest-rate hikes put collective pressure on technology stocks?
2. **Make decisions:** When the economic environment changes, should capital remain in equities, or rotate into bonds?

## What Are Stocks and Bonds?

### Stocks: Ownership and Growth

* **Definition and characteristics:** A stock represents **ownership** (equity) in a publicly listed company. When you purchase a company’s stock, you own a small portion of that company.
* **Return mechanisms:** Stock returns primarily come from two sources:

  * **Capital appreciation:** The stock price rises and investors profit by selling.
  * **Dividend income:** The company distributes part of its profits to shareholders in cash.
* **Role:** Stocks offer the highest return potential, but they are usually accompanied by **high volatility** and **short-term risk**. Their primary role in a portfolio is to provide **long-term capital growth**, with the goal of outperforming inflation.

### Bonds: Credit and Risk Control

* **Definition and characteristics:** A bond is a **debt instrument**. Buying a bond means **lending money** to the issuer (a government or a corporation) and becoming its **creditor**.
* **Return mechanism:** Bonds provide fixed interest payments, known as the **coupon**, and return the principal at maturity.
* **Role:** Bonds generally carry lower risk than stocks. Their primary function is to serve as a **risk-control tool** within a portfolio, providing a buffer when markets decline.

#### Bond Pricing Mechanism: The Inverse Relationship

To understand bonds, one must understand the **inverse relationship** between bond prices and market interest rates. This relationship is based on two core concepts:

1. **Coupon Rate:** The **fixed annual interest rate** determined at issuance, calculated based on face value. It represents the fixed cash flow an investor receives each year and **does not change once the bond is issued**.
2. **Market Yield (Yield to Maturity):** The **actual annualized return** an investor earns when purchasing the bond in the current market. It is determined in real time by supply and demand and the prevailing interest-rate environment.

**The logic linking bond prices and yields:**

The key to understanding this inverse relationship is simple: **the coupon payment is fixed, so the market must adjust the bond’s price to ensure its yield aligns with current interest rates.**

Let’s use a simple analogy to illustrate this adjustment process:

Imagine you own an **“old product”** (an existing bond) that provides a **fixed annual income** of $50.

* **Current market rate (new rate):** This is the return offered by newly issued comparable bonds or bank deposits.

How much should the old product sell for so that a new buyer still finds it attractive?

* **Example 1: Market interest rates rise → Bond prices fall**

When the central bank raises rates or the economy improves, and **new products offer a 6% return**:

1. **The old product becomes less attractive:** Your old bond, which only pays $50, is no longer appealing.
2. **Price is forced to adjust:** To allow a buyer to earn a 6% annual return from the same $50 income, you must sell the bond at a **discount**.

   * You sell it below par (for example, at $950).
   * The buyer pays $950 and still receives $50 annually. Based on a $950 cost, the effective annual return **rises** to 6%.
3. **Conclusion:** When market yields rise (to 6%), the price of existing bonds ($950) **falls**.

* **Example 2: Market interest rates fall → Bond prices rise**

When the central bank cuts rates or the economy weakens, and **new products offer only a 4% return**:

1. **The old product becomes more attractive:** Your old bond, still paying $50, suddenly looks very valuable.
2. **Price commands a premium:** Investors are willing to pay a **premium** (above par, for example $1,050) to own this higher-yielding bond.

   * The buyer pays $1,050 and still receives $50 annually. Based on this higher cost, the effective annual return **falls** to 4%.
3. **Conclusion:** When market yields fall (to 4%), the price of existing bonds ($1,050) **rises**.

#### Will Federal Reserve Rate Cuts Always Push Bond Prices Higher?

Under sustained interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed), the basic transmission mechanism is as follows:

1. **Market rates decline:** Fed rate cuts directly lower **short-term market interest rates**.
2. **Bonds become more attractive:** The overall interest-rate environment declines.
3. **Prices rise:** The fixed coupons of existing bonds appear more valuable, prompting investors to pay higher prices, which pushes bond prices upward.

**Therefore, all else being equal, sustained Fed rate cuts generally lead to rising bond prices—especially for government bonds.**

However, in real markets, this relationship is influenced by two major factors:

**1. Expectations already priced in**

* The bond market is **forward-looking**. If a Fed rate cut is widely expected (for example, a 25-basis-point cut anticipated before an FOMC meeting):

  * Bond prices often **rise in advance**, fully pricing in the expected cut.
  * If the Fed’s action **meets expectations**, price movement may be limited.
  * If the Fed’s action **exceeds expectations** (for example, a larger-than-expected cut), bond prices may rise further.

**2. The impact of inflation**

* Sustained rate cuts are often intended to **stimulate the economy** or counteract recession. However, if markets expect prolonged easing to lead to **significant inflation**, this can negatively affect long-term bond prices:

  * **Inflation risk:** Investors worry that future inflation will erode the **real purchasing power** of fixed coupon payments and principal.
  * **Demand for higher yields:** Investors require higher long-term yields (an inflation premium) as compensation.
  * **Result:** Even as short-term rates fall, long-term bond prices may **stagnate or even decline** due to rising inflation expectations.

In an ideal scenario, Fed rate cuts support rising bond prices. In practice, investors must distinguish between **short-term bonds** (most sensitive to Fed policy rates) and **long-term bonds** (more sensitive to inflation and economic expectations), while also assessing whether rate-cut expectations have already been priced into the market.


## The Relationship Between Stocks and Bonds

Stocks and bonds do not operate independently. Their relationship is a key lens through which to understand capital flows and market sentiment.

### Negative Correlation Between Stocks and Bonds

In most normal economic environments, stocks and high-quality bonds (especially government bonds) tend to exhibit a **negative correlation**. This means that when the price of one asset class rises, the other tends to fall.

**Key drivers behind this relationship:**

* **Equity Risk Premium (ERP) mechanism**
  Stocks are risk assets, and their expected returns must exceed those of bonds. This excess return is known as the **Equity Risk Premium (ERP)**.

  * When **bond yields (the risk-free rate) rise**, investors can earn higher returns without taking risk.
  * As a result, investors demand higher compensation for holding risky equities, reducing the relative attractiveness of stocks and putting **downward pressure on equity valuations**.
  * Conversely, when bond yields fall, the relative attractiveness of stocks increases.
* **Market sentiment and flight-to-safety flows**
  Stocks and bonds play opposing roles in reflecting market sentiment:

  * **Rising risk appetite:** When economic prospects are optimistic, investors shift capital from relatively safe bonds into equities in pursuit of higher growth, leading to **falling bond prices and rising stock prices**.
  * **Rising risk aversion:** During crises or periods of recessionary fear, investors withdraw capital from high-risk equities and move into assets perceived as safest—high-quality government bonds (such as U.S. Treasuries), resulting in **rising bond prices and falling stock prices**.

### Market Differences: U.S. Equities vs. Hong Kong Equities

Although global financial markets share similar underlying logic, differences exist in capital flows and interest-rate benchmarks across markets.

#### U.S. Equity Market: Global Benchmark and Clear Transmission

* U.S. equities (such as the S&P 500) typically exhibit a stable **negative correlation** with U.S. Treasury bonds.
* **U.S. Treasury yields**—especially the 10-year yield—are widely regarded as the **global risk-free rate benchmark**. Changes in these yields directly affect valuations in U.S. and global equity markets through discount rates.

#### Hong Kong Equity Market: Multiple Linkages and U.S. Treasury Influence

* The Hong Kong equity market is linked to Hong Kong’s domestic economy, mainland China, and global capital markets.
* Because Hong Kong operates under a **linked exchange rate system** (the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar), changes in **U.S. Treasury yields** are particularly important for capital flows and valuation in Hong Kong equities.
* As a result, although Hong Kong stocks are also influenced by mainland economic conditions and policies, their **interest-rate and capital-flow dynamics** are fundamentally **similar to—and strongly correlated with—those of U.S. equities and U.S. Treasuries**.

## How Stock Market Movements Affect Bonds

Movements in the stock market often reflect overall market sentiment. This sentiment—whether optimism or panic—directly influences the flow of capital between risk assets (stocks) and safe-haven assets (bonds), thereby affecting bond prices.

### Example 1: Strong Stock Market Rally (Rising Risk Appetite)

In this scenario, stock prices continue to rise, reflecting strong optimism about economic growth prospects.

| :------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Stock movement**        | Equity indices rise rapidly and persistently, such as during an economic recovery or a technology innovation cycle.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Bond response**         | Bond prices **fall**, while yields **rise**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Underlying reason**     | The market expects strong economic growth, accompanied by higher inflation and the possibility of central-bank rate hikes. Investors broadly shift capital from lower-yielding bonds into risk assets such as equities in search of higher returns. Bonds face selling pressure, causing prices to decline. |
| **What investors can do** | Investors may consider **selling part of their equity holdings to lock in gains** and rebalance their portfolios. For those seeking stability, short-term bonds may be attractive, as their prices are less sensitive to long-term interest-rate changes.                                                   |

### Example 2: Panic-Driven Stock Market Sell-Off (Rising Risk Aversion)

The market experiences major negative events (such as a global crisis or heightened recession fears), triggering sharp equity sell-offs.

| :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Stock movement**        | Equity markets decline sharply, with volatility surging.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Bond response**         | Bond prices—especially those of safe-haven government bonds—**rise**, while yields **fall**.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Underlying reason**     | Investors seek safety, pulling capital out of high-risk equities and moving into highly liquid, high-credit-quality government bonds. Strong safe-haven demand pushes bond prices higher.                                                                                             |
| **What investors can do** | This presents an opportunity to **rebalance assets using the “seesaw effect.”** Investors may **sell high-priced safe-haven bonds** to realize capital gains and use the proceeds to **buy undervalued equities** depressed by panic, positioning for a recovery in market sentiment. |

## How Bond Market Movements Affect Stocks

Bond market movements—especially changes in government bond yields—often serve as a **leading indicator** for equity valuations and capital flows. By altering discount rates and the risk-free rate, changes in yields directly influence the relative attractiveness of stocks.

### Example 1: Rapid Rise in Bond Yields (Inflation or Rate-Hike Expectations)

In this scenario, long-term government bond yields rise sharply.

| Factor                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bond movement**         | Long-term government bond yields (such as the 10-year U.S. Treasury) rise rapidly, and prices fall.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Stock response**        | Equity markets come under broad pressure, with **high-valuation, high-growth stocks** (such as technology stocks) experiencing larger declines.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Underlying reason**     | Higher yields directly increase the **discount rate** used in equity valuation models. When future earnings—especially those of high-growth companies—are discounted at higher rates, their **present value declines significantly**. In addition, higher bond yields provide a more competitive risk-free return, drawing some capital out of equities. |
| **What investors can do** | Investors should reassess the risks of high-valuation stocks and consider rotating into **lower-valuation value stocks, financials, or industrials**, which tend to perform more resiliently in rising-rate environments.                                                                                                                                |

### Example 2: Sustained Decline in Bond Yields (Slowing Growth or Rate-Cut Expectations)

In this scenario, long-term government bond yields continue to fall.

| Factor                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bond movement**         | Long-term government bond yields decline steadily, and prices rise.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Stock response**        | Equity markets receive support, particularly **high-growth stocks** and **high-dividend stocks** that are sensitive to interest rates.                                                                                                                                     |
| **Underlying reason**     | Falling yields imply a lower discount rate. The **present value of companies’ future earnings increases**, directly boosting growth-stock valuations. At the same time, lower bond returns make equity dividend yields and potential capital appreciation more attractive. |
| **What investors can do** | Investors may focus on **growth companies** whose valuations rely heavily on future cash flows. In addition, industries that benefit from lower financing costs (such as real estate) also tend to benefit from declining yields.                                          |
