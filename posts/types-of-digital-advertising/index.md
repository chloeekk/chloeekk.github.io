# Comprehensive Guide to Digital Advertising Types


Digital advertising reaches target audiences through diverse formats. This article introduces 11 mainstream advertising types using the **Definition→Targeting Methods→Format Breakdown→Main Platforms** structure.

## 1. Search Ads

Search ads are text or dynamic ads triggered by user search keywords on search engines (e.g., Google, Bing), typically appearing at the top, bottom, or sidebar of search engine results pages (SERPs). Their core logic is **capturing active search intent** by matching keywords to deliver relevant ads.  
![search-ads-example](search-ads-example.png)

### Targeting Methods
- **Keyword Matching Modes**:  
  - **Exact Match**: Triggers only when search terms exactly match keywords (e.g., keyword "sneakers" matches only "sneakers").  
  - **Broad Match**: Covers synonyms or related terms (e.g., "sneakers" may match "running shoes" or "men's sneakers").  
  - **Phrase Match**: Requires search terms to contain the complete keyword phrase (e.g., "blue sneakers" matches "2025 new blue sneakers").  
- **Search Intent Analysis**:  
  - Uses semantic analysis to distinguish user needs (e.g., **commercial intent** "buy Nike running shoes" vs. **informational intent** "how to choose running shoes").
