# PPC Keyword Analysis Guide


Pay-per-click (PPC) advertising has become an important tool for companies to gain traffic and increase conversions. The selection of PPC keywords is directly related to the effectiveness of advertising and the return on investment (ROI). Effective keywords can help ads accurately reach the target audience and ensure that the company's ads stand out when potential customers search for relevant information.

## Classification of PPC keywords

PPC keywords are specific words or phrases selected by advertisers when using pay-per-click advertising, which directly affects the exposure and conversion rate of ads. Effective keyword classification helps advertisers develop more precise advertising strategies. The following are several major keyword classification methods:

| Classification | Definition | Example |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Based on user search intent** | | |
| Informational keywords | Users want to obtain information and usually do not intend to buy immediately. | "How to choose sports shoes" |
| Navigational keywords | Users look for specific websites or brands. | "Nike official website" |
| Transactional keywords | Users are ready to buy, usually containing words such as "buy" and "price". | "Buy sneakers" |
| Comparative keywords | Users want to compare different products to make a purchase decision. | "Nike vs. Adidas sneakers" |
| **Classification by matching method** | | |
| Broad match keywords | Attract a wider range of traffic, and the ad will still be displayed when users search for similar words. | "Sneakers" |
| Phrase match keywords | Users search for a phrase containing a specified phrase, and other words can be before and after. | "Sneakers purchase" |
| Exact match keywords | Users must enter exactly the same words for the ad to be displayed. | "[Sneakers]" |
| Negative keywords | Exclude certain irrelevant searches to avoid wasting advertising budget. | "Cheap" |
| **Brand keywords** | Keywords related to a specific brand, which help to increase brand awareness and loyalty. | "Nike sneakers" |
| **Long tail keywords** | Consists of multiple words, with low search volume but high conversion rate. | "Men's running shoes" |

## Paid keyword selection

### 1. Choose highly relevant keywords

- **Goal consistency**: Make sure the selected keywords are consistent with the goal and content of the ad. For example, if your ad is about "running shoes", avoid using keywords that are not related to "casual shoes".

- **User intent**: Understand the user's intention when searching. Choosing keywords that can meet specific needs, such as "shoes suitable for long-distance running" or "running shoes discount", can attract more interested users.

### 2. Consider keyword competitiveness and search volume

- **Competition**: Evaluate the competition of keywords. Although high-search volume keywords may attract more traffic, they also mean higher competition and costs. You can choose keywords with medium competition to reduce CPC (cost per click).

- **Conversion rate**: Conversion rate refers to the ratio of users who complete the target behavior (such as purchase, registration, etc.) after clicking on the ad. A high conversion rate means that the ad not only attracts clicks, but also achieves marketing goals. By analyzing conversion rate data, identify keywords that perform well and optimize advertising delivery strategies.

### 4. Use negative keywords

- **The role of negative keywords**: Negative keywords refer to keywords that you want to exclude. By setting negative keywords, you can avoid ads from being displayed in irrelevant search results, thereby improving the accuracy of ads.

- **Optimize advertising spending**: Regularly review search query reports, identify sources of invalid clicks and add corresponding negative keywords to help save advertising budgets and increase ROI.

### 5. Conduct A/B testing

- **Test different keywords**: A/B test different keyword combinations and analyze their performance. You can test different keywords, ad copy, or landing page design to find the best combination.

- **Continuous optimization**: Based on the test results, continuously adjust the keyword strategy. Identify which keywords are performing well and which need to be optimized or replaced to ensure that the ads continue to achieve the best results.

### 6. Regularly review and update keywords

- **Monitor performance**: Use tools such as Google Ads to regularly monitor keyword performance, view data such as CTR, conversion rate, and CPC, and evaluate keyword performance.

- **Market dynamics**: Update the keyword list in a timely manner based on market changes and changes in consumer behavior. Regularly reviewing and adjusting keywords can ensure that the ads are always consistent with the needs of the target audience.
