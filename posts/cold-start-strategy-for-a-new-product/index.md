# Cold Start Strategy for a New Product


Have you ever invited YouTube creators to review your product? How effective do you think it was?

If your answer is “It brought short-term traffic, but the conversion and retention rates were poor,” then you’ve likely invested your precious early-stage resources in the wrong target.

During the cold-start phase of a product, resources are scarce, and every decision must be accurate and efficient. Many companies instinctively rely on traditional affiliate marketing, hoping to scale quickly with commissions. However, evidence shows that in many cases this is an **inefficient and noise-filled approach**:

1. **Inefficient acquisition: Lack of precision**

   * Affiliates aim to maximize commission income, not product–user fit. They often cast a wide net, promoting the product to audiences who do not truly need it.
   * This results in traffic coming in, but with very low willingness to pay and very low long-term retention. **Money is spent on short-lived, unstable users.**

2. **Noise pollution: Fatal for product feedback**

   * During the early search for PMF, your most valuable asset is **high-quality user feedback**. Users brought in through inefficient acquisition are not your core audience, so their feedback is often scattered, superficial, or irrelevant.
   * If the product team is misled by this “noise,” they may invest significant effort into solving the pain points of non-core users, **severely drifting from the product’s core value and long-term vision**, which can be fatal to early iterations.

A true growth flywheel is driven by **the product’s own ability to promote itself**. The early task is not to find “sellers,” but to find **co-builders** who can accelerate Product-Market Fit (PMF).



## Partners vs. Affiliates: The Fundamental Difference

Since high-value Partners are crucial for early growth, how do we clearly distinguish these two roles and avoid misallocating scarce early-stage resources?
The core issue lies in the significant differences in **motivation and value output**.

### Affiliates: A money-driven, short-term relationship

Affiliates are focused on **transactions**. Their goal is to earn money through commissions or sales-based compensation. Their promotional activity is essentially a sales job driven by financial reward.

* **Driving force:** Commission rate, sales targets, withdrawal cycles
* **Value output:** Generates traffic and sales in the short term
* **Major drawback:** They are not necessarily deep users of the product. Their promotions often lack depth of experience and understanding, making it difficult to provide constructive product feedback. The users they bring are induced by short-term benefits and are typically low-retention “noise” users.

### Partners: A vision-driven, long-term relationship

Partners are focused on **co-building**. They come from your real, heavy-use user base. They can see the product’s potential, vision, and direction and are willing to invest time and energy to help shape it.

* **Driving force:** Belief in the product’s success, exclusive privileges, involvement in product definition, building industry influence
* **Value output:** High-quality product feedback; authoritative industry endorsement; lower-cost acquisition of high-quality promotion and case studies
* **Core asset:** The **trust they bring is priceless**. They help refine the product, shape early reputation, and influence long-term direction.

During the critical PMF search period, what we urgently need are **product insights** and **highly targeted traffic**. Partners are the best source of both. Treat Partners as **external members of the product team**, not outsourced sales of the marketing team. This is the first step to cold-start success.



## Cold-Start Strategy: Scope and Precise Selection

The “Partner-driven” growth strategy is suitable for all digital products and services that rely heavily on **community trust**, **professional endorsement**, and **educational content**.

### Applicability of the strategy

This high-value, high-retention approach applies to products that need to build trust through **word of mouth and deep content**:

| Product Type                               | Applicability Analysis                                                                                                                                    | Examples                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Creator Economy Tools**                  | Highly applicable. Relies on KOL/KOC sharing productivity tools as part of the value they create.                                                         | Podcast editing SaaS, design-template platforms, AI writing assistants    |
| **Developer Tools / AI Coding Assistants** | Highly applicable. Relies on authoritative figures in developer communities to provide tutorials and bug reports, penetrating through community trust.    | Collaboration API platforms, vertical-specific AI code completion tools   |
| **Vertical Industry Tools**                | Applicable. Requires industry experts to validate workflows and provide authoritative endorsement.                                                        | Legal document management tools, specialized medical data analytics tools |
| **FinTech / Web3 Platforms**               | Highly applicable. Trust is the core asset. Needs opinion leaders to analyze features and provide compliance feedback to establish community credibility. | Personal finance planners, Web3 analytics platforms                       |

### Screening mechanism: From influence to Partner potential

Once you anchor the right community, you need to identify high-impact Partners from a large user base.
The screening logic should be: **Quantify influence first, then qualitatively assess Partner potential.**

* **Step 1: Quantify influence metrics (initial screening)**

  * First, examine the creator’s objective metrics. For YouTube, this includes: **subscriber count**, **upload frequency**, and **type/quality of content**.
  * **Tools & methods:** Use Clearbit, Apollo, and similar tools to enrich user data, reverse-lookup their social profiles through email or IDs, and assess **influence weight** and **expertise**.
  * **Tip:** User registration data (email domains, linked social accounts) can help identify **hidden high-influence creators** or expand your ideal user persona.

* **Step 2: Qualitative assessment of Partner potential**

  * After identifying high-influence users, determine whether they can become Partners.
  * **Core criteria:**

    * **Usage signals:** Has the user already registered or shown **some usage activity**? (Contacting an existing user is always easier than cold-reaching a stranger.)
    * **Feedback intent:** Have they **proactively provided feedback** or suggestions before? Even simple questions show interest and investment.
    * **Content alignment:** Does their content style align with your product vision?
  * **Principle:** Look for creators who **show enthusiasm and co-building intent** even before being contacted. These are true Partner candidates.



## Building long-term relationships: Turning passion into sustainable mutual benefit

The passion that Partners bring is the most valuable asset during the cold-start phase. However, you cannot expect them to “work for love” forever.
To sustain collaboration, you must establish a formal, transparent **Brand Partner Program** or similar system to convert early enthusiasm into long-term economic and value reciprocity.

Creators’ enthusiasm is limited. If collaboration remains at “free use” or “moral support,” it will lead to:

* **Relationship breakdown:** Passion fades when bugs appear or competitors emerge.
* **Value mismatch:** Creators invest time and influence without receiving adequate compensation or brand support.
* **Unsustainable cooperation:** Long-term collaboration cannot survive without a formal structure.

Thus, you must establish a **stable, formal economic relationship** as early as possible.

The core principle is: **ensure the collaboration is mutual and the value exchange is explicit.** For example:

| Collaboration Item                                   | Purpose                                                     | Key Elements                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Exclusive privileges (identity recognition)**      | Strengthen Partners’ sense of status and exclusivity.       | Free/discounted access; exclusive early access to new features/Beta; special badges or certifications                                                                                                    |
| **Communication channels (efficient collaboration)** | Ensure their feedback reaches the product team effectively. | Dedicated Slack/Discord channels; direct access to PMs and engineers; priority handling of feedback                                                                                                      |
| **Value exchange (core benefits)**                   | Ensure economic rationality and brand reciprocity.          | **Financial compensation:** fixed brand collaboration fees or stipends (not just sales commissions); **Promotional exchange:** co-promotion through official channels, boosting Partner brand visibility |

By establishing such structured systems, you convert emotional enthusiasm into economic and brand value, embedding early goodwill into the long-term growth flywheel.



## The Next Foundation of Growth

The **ultimate value** of the Partner strategy is that it solves the two core cold-start problems: **noise traffic** and **ineffective feedback**. It integrates acquisition, product refinement, and brand building in a high-leverage way, helping the product find PMF quickly and accurately.

Once cold start succeeds and the first batch of Partners help confirm PMF, the focus of growth shifts.
The foundation of long-term company growth becomes **paid conversion** and **high retention**.

This requires the team to develop the following capabilities:

* **Flexible pricing strategy:** Based on early user feedback, design flexible pricing models around **customization** or **high-value features** to rapidly find the best monetization path.
* **Data-driven optimization:** Build strong **full-lifecycle A/B testing capabilities**, using data to continuously optimize the conversion funnel and retention flows.
* **Protecting existing users:** Early and existing users determine ARR stability. Therefore, **always protect the interests of early users**, not only to retain them but also to preserve the reputation and trust created through the Partnership strategy.

The Partnership strategy is the beginning of the journey. It brings your first group of the most loyal and valuable “spark” users. Maintaining and expanding that spark is the key to achieving long-term, sustainable product growth.
