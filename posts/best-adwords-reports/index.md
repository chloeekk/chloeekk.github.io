## What are AdWords reports?

The core of advertising optimization lies in data-driven decision-making, and Google AdWords (now known as Google Ads) reports are the key tools to achieve this goal. With AdWords reports, advertisers can gain in-depth insights into the performance of their campaigns and find areas that need to be optimized to maximize the effectiveness and return on investment (ROI) of their ads.

AdWords reports are data reports generated by the Google Ads platform that can display various key data of the campaign in detail, including impressions, click-through rate, conversion rate, cost, etc. With this data, advertisers can monitor the performance of their ads and identify which advertising strategies are effective and which ones need to be adjusted. More specifically, AdWords reports help marketers:
- **Evaluate the performance of the campaign**: How is the exposure of the ad among the target audience? Is the click-through rate as expected?
- **Analyze the performance of keywords**: Which keywords have brought more clicks and conversions? Which keywords are performing poorly and may need to be removed or optimized?
- **Optimize advertising delivery**: Based on the data provided by the report, optimize [ad copy](https://chloevolution.com/posts/create-sem-copy/), creativity, bidding strategy, etc. to further improve advertising effectiveness.
- **Monitor budget consumption**: Is advertising expenditure reasonable? How to optimize budget allocation based on report data and improve advertising ROI?

## Common AdWords report types and important metrics

### Keyword performance report

Keywords are the cornerstone of Google Ads advertising. Keyword performance reports can help advertisers understand the actual performance of each keyword, find out which words can bring more clicks and conversions, and which words may waste budget. By analyzing this report, advertisers can adjust bidding strategies in a targeted manner, optimize keywords for advertising, and thus improve overall advertising performance.

**Important metrics**:

- **Click-through rate (CTR)**: Measures the ability of a keyword to attract clicks. The higher the click-through rate, the more attractive the keyword is to the target audience.

- **Conversion rate**: Analyzes the performance of keywords in users completing conversions (such as purchases, registrations, etc.). Keywords with high conversion rates are worth investing more budget.

- **Average cost per click (CPC)**: The average amount advertisers pay for each click. By monitoring CPC, advertisers can evaluate the return on investment of keywords.

- **Keyword Quality Score**: Google Ads gives a score from 1 to 10 based on factors such as keyword relevance, click-through rate, and the quality of the ad and the target page. A high quality score usually means lower CPC and better ad placement.

- **Impressions**: Impressions reflect how often a keyword triggers ad impressions. Combined with click-through rate analysis, the popularity of the keyword can be evaluated.

- **Cost per conversion (CPA)**: The cost paid by advertisers for each conversion. This metric can help advertisers evaluate the overall economic benefits of specific keywords.

By regularly analyzing keyword performance reports, advertisers can more accurately identify efficient keywords and budget-wasting words, and then adjust strategies to improve overall advertising performance.

### Campaign Performance Report

The Campaign Performance Report is a core tool for comprehensively evaluating the performance of advertising campaigns. It can help advertisers analyze the performance of each campaign from a global level and determine which types of advertising creativity, budget allocation, and advertising targeting are most effective. Through this report, advertisers can optimize the campaign structure and clarify which advertising campaigns can be further expanded and which ones need to be adjusted or stopped.

**Important Metrics**:

- **Total Number of Clicks on a Campaign**: The more clicks you get, the more attractive your ad is. This metric is a quick way to assess the overall popularity of a campaign.

- **Conversion Rate**: Whether a campaign can lead to actual business growth, conversion rate is a key metric. A campaign with a high conversion rate indicates that the delivery strategy is effective.

- **Return on Investment (ROI)**: By analyzing the ROI of a campaign, advertisers can understand the benefits of every dollar spent on advertising and ensure that their investment is paying off.

- **Cost Per Thousand Impressions (CPM)**: CPM reflects the cost of an ad under a large number of impressions and is a key metric for measuring the economic benefits of ad impressions, especially for brand exposure campaigns.

- **Average Cost Per Click (CPC)**: The average cost paid by an advertiser for an ad click. CPC combined with conversion rate can help advertisers determine whether it is worthwhile to further increase the budget for a campaign.

- **Number of Conversions and Cost**: The number of conversions refers to the number of purchases, registrations, etc. completed through an ad, while the cost of a conversion is the cost paid by the advertiser for each conversion. Campaigns with low conversion costs and high conversion numbers deserve more budget.

Regularly analyzing campaign performance reports can help advertisers adjust budget allocation, optimize advertising strategies, and ensure that overall advertising delivery is consistent with business goals.

### Device Performance Report

Modern users may access ads through various devices (such as mobile phones, tablets, desktop computers, etc.). The device performance report helps advertisers analyze the performance of ads on different devices, evaluate the ad display, clicks, and conversions on each device, and optimize the delivery strategy for different devices. This report is particularly useful for campaigns that are displayed across devices to ensure that ads are presented in the best way on each device.

**Important metrics**:

- **Device classification (desktop, mobile, tablet)**: Data divided by device type can show which devices the ads perform best.

- **Cost per click (CPC)**: The CPC difference between devices can show the cost-effectiveness of ads on different devices.

- **Conversion rate**: User behavior on different devices may vary greatly. Analyzing the conversion rate of each device can help optimize cross-device delivery strategies.

- **Click-through rate (CTR)**: The difference in click-through rate of ads on different devices can help advertisers evaluate the device adaptability of ads.

- **Number of impressions**: The number of impressions can show how often ads are exposed on different devices, helping advertisers optimize display strategies.

- **Conversion cost**: The difference in conversion cost between devices can help advertisers allocate budgets more effectively.

By analyzing the device performance report, advertisers can better understand user behavior across devices and ensure that ads are displayed and user experience is optimized on each device.

### Geographic location report

The geographic location report provides the performance of ads in different regions, helping advertisers adjust their advertising strategies based on the user's geographic location. User needs, click habits, and purchasing behaviors in different regions may vary greatly. Through this report, advertisers can more accurately target advertising areas and improve advertising relevance and conversion rates.

**Important metrics**:

- **Click-through rate (CTR) by geographic location**: The performance of CTR in different geographic regions can show which regions' ads are more attractive to the target audience.

- **Conversion rate by geographic location**: By analyzing the conversion rates of different regions, advertisers can optimize regional delivery strategies and focus on those regions with better conversion results.

- **Average cost per click (CPC)**: Based on the CPC differences in regions, advertisers can allocate budgets more reasonably and ensure that they increase investment in regions with high conversion rates.

- **Number of impressions**: Analyze the frequency of ad display in each region to find out which regions have more ad exposure but poor results, thereby optimizing display strategies.

- **Cost per acquisition (CPA) within region**: Conversion cost is the core metric for evaluating the effectiveness of advertising in each region, helping advertisers find the most cost-effective delivery area.

Regularly analyzing geographic location reports can help advertisers optimize advertising delivery strategies in different regions and accurately grasp market trends.

### Conversion tracking report

The conversion tracking report is a core tool for evaluating advertising effectiveness. It records in detail the entire path from users seeing the ad to the final conversion, helping advertisers understand the user's conversion process and find optimization points. By analyzing this report, advertisers can identify which channels and advertising strategies are most effective in driving conversions, and then optimize advertising delivery to improve overall conversion rates.

**Important metrics**:

- **Number of conversions**: The number of conversions is a direct reflection of the final effect of advertising, showing how much actual business growth the advertising has brought.

- **Cost per conversion (CPA)**: Measures the cost paid by advertisers for each conversion. Lowering CPA means a higher return on investment for advertising.

- **Conversion rate**: The conversion rate is a direct reflection of the effectiveness of advertising, and advertising strategies with high conversion rates are usually worth further investment.

- **Conversion path**: Analyzing the steps that users go through before conversion can help advertisers optimize the conversion process and reduce unnecessary steps.

- **Average clicks**: The number of times users click on an ad before the final conversion can show the attractiveness and conversion efficiency of the ad.

Through conversion tracking reports, advertisers can better understand the user's behavior path, optimize advertising strategies, and improve overall conversion rates.

## Case: How to use AdWords reports to optimize advertising strategies

Suppose an online furniture retailer "A Home" is running Google Ads advertising, with the goal of increasing the purchase conversion rate on its website and hoping to bring more orders through advertising. The advertising has covered multiple campaigns, used different keywords, and covered multiple devices and regions. Now, A Home has decided to analyze the advertising performance through detailed AdWords reports and further optimize its delivery strategy. Here are the steps for how A Home can achieve this goal through five reports and their important metrics.

### Keyword Performance Report

First, A Home will check the **Keyword Performance Report** to analyze whether the keywords used in its ads have brought the expected clicks and conversions. Through this report, they found that some keywords have a high click-through rate (CTR), such as "solid wood furniture" and "modern style sofa", while other keywords, such as "folding table" and "bedroom lamps", have a low CTR and conversion rate.

- **Click-through rate (CTR)**: A Home found that the click-through rate of "solid wood furniture" reached 6%, which is higher than the average, which means that this keyword has a strong appeal to the target users. Based on this finding, they decided to increase the budget for this keyword.

- **Conversion rate**: By observing the conversion rate of keywords, they found that although the CTR of "folding table" was low, the conversion rate was high, indicating that most of the users who clicked on this keyword were accurate purchase intention users. A Home therefore decided to keep this keyword and optimize it more accurately.

- **Average cost per click (CPC)**: A Home analyzed the CPC and found that the CPC of "modern style sofa" was high, reaching $2.50 per click. This shows that although the keyword performed well, the cost was high, so they needed to evaluate whether the keyword was worth keeping this bid.

Through this report, A Home identified which keywords needed more budget, which could reduce the bid, and which needed to be optimized to maximize the advertising effect.

### Campaign Performance Report

Next, A Home analyzed the **Campaign Performance Report** to evaluate the overall performance of different campaigns. They found that the "Summer Promotion Campaign" brought a lot of clicks, but the conversion rate was relatively low, indicating that although more users browsed the website, few users finally completed the purchase.

- **Conversion rate**: They noticed that the conversion rate of the "Spring New Product Series" was as high as 8%, which was much higher than the 3% of the "Summer Promotion Campaign". Based on this data, A Home decided to adjust the advertising copy and target audience of the summer promotion campaign in order to increase the conversion rate.

- **Return on Investment (ROI)**: By analyzing the ROI of the campaigns, A Home found that the "Modern Furniture Campaign" had the highest ROI, reaching 200%. Therefore, they decided to continue to increase the budget of this campaign to further expand its influence.

This report helped A Home identify which campaigns brought high conversion rates and high ROI, and which ones needed to be optimized to improve the effect.

### Device Performance Report

When A Home looked at the **Device Performance Report**, it found that the click-through rate (CTR) of ads on mobile devices was significantly higher than that on desktops, but the conversion rate on mobile devices was relatively low. This shows that although mobile users are more likely to click on ads, they do not complete the purchase.

- **Click-through rate (CTR)**: The CTR on mobile devices is 5.5%, higher than 4% on desktops, indicating that ads on mobile devices are more attractive to users.

- **Conversion rate**: However, the conversion rate on mobile is only 2%, much lower than the 5% on desktop. Therefore, A Home Furnishing decided to optimize its mobile user experience, including speeding up the loading speed of the mobile website and simplifying the purchase process to increase the conversion rate of mobile users.

Through the device performance report, A Home Furnishing can better understand the differences between devices and optimize advertising strategies to improve the conversion rate on mobile.

### Geographic location report

A Home Furnishing's products are sold nationwide. They hope to analyze the advertising performance in different regions through the **geographic location report** to optimize the regional delivery strategy. Through analysis, they found that the advertising performance in some cities is very good, while other regions are mediocre.

- **Click-through rate (CTR) by geographic location**: They found that the CTR of first-tier cities such as Beijing and Shanghai is significantly higher than that of other regions, indicating that users in these regions are more interested in advertising.

- **Conversion rate by geographic location**: However, through the analysis of conversion rate, they found that although the conversion rate in the southwest region has a small number of clicks, the conversion rate is as high as 10%, which is higher than the conversion rate in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. This means that users in the southwest region have stronger purchasing intentions, and A Home Furnishing decided to increase advertising budgets in these regions and further expand advertising.

This report helped A Home Furnishing optimize its regional advertising strategy to ensure that advertising efforts were increased in areas with stronger purchasing intentions.

### Conversion Tracking Report

Finally, A Home Furnishing analyzed the customer's purchase path through the **conversion tracking report** to understand which steps affect conversions and find points that can be optimized. They found that many users did not buy immediately after clicking on the ad, but completed the conversion after browsing multiple product pages.

- **Conversion Path**: Most users need to click on 3 different ads and product pages before they finally make a purchase. This suggests that A Home Furnishing needs to simplify the user's browsing path, perhaps by optimizing website navigation or providing relevant product recommendations to increase conversion rates.

- **Cost Per Conversion (CPA)**: Through CPA analysis, they found that the CPA of the "Bedroom Furniture Series" was high, reaching $50. This means that A Home Furnishing needs to optimize the advertising strategy for this series and reduce unnecessary advertising spending.

Through the conversion tracking report, A Home Furnishing can have a deeper understanding of the user's conversion behavior and optimize every link in the user's conversion path.

## Data analysis methods and common misunderstandings

### Data analysis methods

- **Horizontal comparison**: By comparing the performance of different campaigns, keywords or devices horizontally, you can quickly identify which advertising strategies perform best. For example, by comparing the CTR and conversion rate of different campaigns, advertisers can clearly know which campaigns should increase their budgets.

- **Time trend analysis**: View the changing trend of advertising performance in different time periods (such as days, weeks, and months), helping advertisers to grasp the fluctuations in delivery effects and make timely adjustments. For example, if the CTR of a campaign suddenly drops on a certain day, you need to check whether the external factors or advertising settings of that day have changed.

- **Cross analysis**: Combine multiple indicators for cross analysis. For example, by combining CTR with conversion rate, advertisers can determine whether the advertisement can attract clicks and effectively convert; by combining CPC with conversion cost analysis, you can evaluate whether the advertising cost is reasonable.

### Common misunderstandings

- **Over-focus on a single indicator**: Many advertisers over-focus on a single indicator and ignore the overall performance when analyzing. For example, paying too much attention to click-through rate and ignoring conversion rate will result in a large number of clicks, but no actual business growth. Advertisers should combine multiple indicators to comprehensively evaluate the advertising effect.

- **Ignoring external factors**: Advertising effect is not only related to the delivery strategy, but also affected by external market factors. For example, holidays, industry off-seasons, policy changes, etc. will affect advertising performance. Therefore, when analyzing data, advertisers need to consider the potential impact of these external factors on advertising effect.

- **Ignoring the long-tail effect**: Some poorly performing keywords or campaigns may not perform well in the short term, but can bring good ROI in the long run. Advertisers should combine long-term data trends to avoid stopping certain campaigns prematurely due to short-term fluctuations.

- **Misunderstanding the relationship between CPC and ROI**: High CPC does not necessarily mean poor advertising performance, the key lies in ROI. If CPC is high, but the conversion rate is high and the revenue after conversion far exceeds the advertising expenditure, advertisers can still get a positive return on investment. Therefore, you cannot decide whether to lower the advertising bid based solely on CPC, but should consider the conversion effect comprehensively.

## FAQ

### 1. Why do my reports show high clicks but low conversion rates?
High clicks but low conversion rates usually mean that users are interested in the ad, but the landing page or product after the ad fails to successfully attract them to convert. Possible reasons include:
- **Poor landing page experience**: If the landing page loads slowly, has an unattractive design, or lacks a clear call to action (CTA), users are likely to leave quickly after clicking the ad, resulting in a lower conversion rate.
- **Mismatch between ad and landing page**: If the ad content is inconsistent with the information on the landing page, users may be confused or disappointed. Ensuring consistency between ad copy and landing page information is key to improving conversion rates.
- **Inaccurate audience targeting**: If the audience targeted by the ad does not match the target population of the product, it will be difficult to generate effective conversions even with a large number of clicks. Adjust the audience, keywords, or placement of the ad to ensure that the ad is displayed to the most relevant potential customers.
- **High competition**: In some highly competitive industries, although users may click on the ad, the conversion rate may be affected because other brands have more attractive products or services.

**Recommendations**:
- Optimize the user experience of your landing page, make sure the page loads quickly, and the information is concise and clear.
- Check the match between your ad copy and your landing page to make sure they complement each other.
- Re-examine your target audience to make sure your ad is only shown to users who are truly interested in your product.

### 2. How do I choose the report that's best for me?
Choosing the right AdWords report depends on your marketing goals and the scale of your campaign. Here are a few key considerations:

- **Marketing goals**: First, clarify what your advertising goals are - is it to increase brand awareness, increase website traffic, or increase sales and conversion rates? Different goals require different reports to track results.
- If your goal is to increase **brand awareness**, then **impressions**, **click-through rate** and other indicators are more important.
- If your goal is **sales conversion**, then **conversion rate**, **CPA** and other indicators directly related to sales are the focus.

- **Ad type**: Different ad formats require different reports. Text ads may be more suitable for viewing **keyword performance reports**, while display ads are suitable for viewing **display ad performance reports**.

- **Audience targeting**: If you are targeting different geographic locations, devices or interest groups when segmenting your audience or running ads, reports such as **Device performance report** and **Geographic location report** will help you analyze the advertising performance of different groups and optimize your delivery strategy.

- **Budget and delivery scale**: For large-scale advertising, it will be more efficient to choose reporting tools with automation functions (such as Swydo or ReportGarden). Small and medium-sized businesses can use free tools such as **Google Data Studio** for customized reports.

**Suggestions**:
- Clarify your advertising goals and match the most relevant report type.
- Check the advertising performance report regularly to optimize the ad copy, audience and delivery strategy.
- Use automated reporting tools to save time and ensure real-time data updates.
