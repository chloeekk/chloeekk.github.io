## Analysis of Paid Traffic Trend

Monday.com began advertising in September 2017, with an expansionary trend, peaking in June 2019. After that, it slowly reduced its investment in advertising and paid traffic leveled off relatively. Paid keywords for both September 2017 and June 2019 time points are analyzed separately next:
