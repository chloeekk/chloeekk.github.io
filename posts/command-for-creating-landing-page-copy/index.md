# Landing Page Copy Commands Templates


A thorough understanding of landing page structure and the copy characteristics of each module is essential to guide AI in producing appropriate, conversion-driven copy.


## Copy Characteristics by Landing Page Module 
### Hero Section
#### Headline 
   - Use "verb + quantifiable result" structure  
     *Example:* "Generate 100+ Marketing Copies/Day" (Better than "Smart Copy Tool")  
   - Mobile: ≤9 Chinese characters, Desktop: ≤15 Chinese characters  

#### Subheadline
   - Follow "pain point scenario → solution" formula  
     *Example:* "Manual writing too slow? AI 10x speed ensures daily updates"  

#### CTA Button
   - Build triple motivation:  
     - Urgency: "Last 3 free spots"  
     - Low-barrier commitment: "Try free in 10 seconds"  
     - Loss aversion: "Wasting ¥37,200/year?"  



### Features/Benefits Module 
#### Feature Description  
   - Technical term translation formula:  
     "[Technical term] → [User action] → [Verifiable result]"  
     *Example:* "NLP algorithm → Auto-match industry keywords → 59% higher read completion"  

#### Benefit Tiering
   | Tier | Focus | Example |  
   |---|---|---|  
   | Core Value | Solve specific problems | 1-minute draft generation |  
   | Advanced Value | Prevent risks | Auto compliance check |  
   | Strategic Value | Create extended benefits | Boost brand search index |  


### Social Proof Module  
#### Testimonials 
   - Four-element structure:  
     "[Identity] encountered [quantified problem] in [specific scenario], achieved [contrast result] after use"  
     *Example:* "Maternal e-commerce operator producing 50 copies/day with 15% error rate → 4x efficiency & zero errors"  

#### Data Presentation 
   - Regular data: Magnify base numbers ("152,370+ users served")  
   - Sensitive data: Precise decimals ("92.37% approval rate")  
   - Dynamic data: Create urgency ("1 new user every 3 seconds")  


### Bottom Navigation  
#### Primary CTA Enhancement 
   - Value reinforcement: "Reiterating: You'll gain ______"  
   - Cost minimization: "Only requires ______ (time/money)"  

#### Exit-Intent Strategy  
   - Active retention:  
     "Confirm before leaving: Have you obtained [free resource]?"  
     *Example:* "Confirm: Have you downloaded《2024 Copy Trends Whitepaper》?"  
   - Secondary option:  
     "Not ready? Subscribe to weekly case studies (Wednesdays)"  


### Prohibited Copy Types  
- Vague adjectives: "High-quality", "Professional", "Leading"  
- Ambiguous claims: "Improve efficiency" → Quantify instead  
- Passive voice: "You will get" → Change to "Claim now"  


## Is AI Suitable for Landing Page Copy Generation? 

### Core Value of AI Generation
#### Scalable Production
- **Batch generation**: 15-20 headline variations per command  
  *Example prompt:*  
  "Generate 10 ecommerce headlines covering urgency, clear benefits, and scenarios"  

- **Multilingual adaptation**:  
  CN source → Literal translation → Localization adjustments  

- **Modular automation**:  
  | Module | AI Output |  
  |---|---|  
  | FAQ | Q&A from product docs |  
  | Specs | Tech features → User benefits |  
  | Cases | Client data → Scenario testimonials |  

#### Historical Data Learning 
- Extracts high-conversion elements:  
  - Action verbs ("Save"/"Boost"/"Avoid")  
  - Number patterns (%/time/currency)  



### Core Limitations & Risks  
#### Emotional Expression Limits
- Lacks authentic storytelling:  
  *AI output:* "Great product! Recommended"  
  *Human edit:* "As a mother of three, saving 2 hours daily reclaims my learning time"  

- Lacks credible social proof details:  
  - Generic testimonials without scenarios  
  - Unverified data claims  

#### Brand Consistency Risks  
- Tone inconsistencies:  
  | Module | AI Issues |  
  |---|---|  
  | Product specs | Overly technical |  
  | Testimonials | Overly colloquial |  

- Core message dilution:  
  - Insufficient brand keyword density (recommend ≥5%)  
  - Inconsistent value propositions  

#### Logical Validation Gaps 
- Causality errors:  
  *Flawed logic:* "Saves time because complex to use"  

- Legal compliance blind spots:  
  | Industry | Risks |  
  |---|---|  
  | Healthcare | Misused efficacy claims |  
  | Finance | ROI guarantees |  
  | Education | Fabricated case studies |  

#### Creativity Boundaries
- Poor industry term conversion:  
  *Input:* "HTAP hybrid load support"  
  *AI output:* "Efficient data processing"  
  *Ideal:* "Real-time transaction analysis + operational reports"  

- Template dependency:  
  Overused patterns: "Achieve...through..." / "Help you..."  



### Usage Boundaries 
#### Safe Applications
- Information-dense > emotion-driven modules  
  *Recommended:* Spec tables, feature comparisons  
  *Avoid:* Brand manifestos, founder stories  

- Standardized > personalized content  
  *Recommended:* Localization frameworks  
  *Avoid:* Limited-edition product descriptions  

#### Risk Control Checklist
  | Checkpoint | Standard |  
  |---|---|  
  | Emotional depth | ≥1 concrete user scenario |  
  | Brand consistency | ≥3 core keywords/1k words |  
  | Legal compliance | Blocklisted term screening |
