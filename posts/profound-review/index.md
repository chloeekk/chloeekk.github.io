## Conversion Paths

It includes three traditional conversion points and one unique interactive flow:

![profound-buttons](profound-buttons.png)


### Get a Demo

The “Get a Demo” button appears both in the top-right navigation and the hero section—clearly **Profound’s primary conversion entry point**.  
The white button stands out against a dark background, emphasizing its importance.

Clicking it opens a clean, professional form:

![get-a-demo-form](get-a-demo-form.png)

The left side includes:

  * A brief description of the form’s purpose
  * Demo content overview
  * Client testimonials

The right-side form requests: name, business email, company name, company size, source of referral, and an **“Are you an agency?”** checkbox.  
This aligns with standard **B2B lead qualification** practices, ensuring high-quality prospects.

### Get Started

Unlike the full demo form, clicking “Get Started” first prompts the user to **enter their work email**.

![get-started-form](get-started-form.png)

The right side features rotating client testimonials, plus a “Schedule a call” option for those interested in a live demo.

After entering an email, **Profound** asks for **company size** and whether the user is an **agency**.  
The progress bar indicates a **multi-step guided onboarding**—a design that encourages completion while collecting detailed user data.

![get-started-form-2](get-started-form-2.png)

### Log in

Interestingly, the **Log in** interface is the same as the **Get Started** one.  
Profound uses logic-based detection to determine whether the email belongs to a **new or existing user**, streamlining access through a unified entry experience.

### Analyze

Beyond traditional entry points, Profound offers a unique **interactive module**.  
By entering a specific website and clicking “Analyze,” you can instantly check its **AI visibility**:

![analyze-ai-visibility](analyze-ai-visibility.png)

No ownership verification is required.  
For example, testing with Shopify yields a brief visibility summary and competitor snapshot:
