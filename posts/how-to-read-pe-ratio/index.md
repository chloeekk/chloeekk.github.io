# How to Read P/E Ratio?


**Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio)** is one of the most commonly used metrics for assessing a stock’s valuation. It directly compares a stock’s **price** to the company’s **earnings power**.

1. **What is it?**
   The P/E ratio, simply put, tells you how many dollars you must pay in price for **every $1 of profit** a company earns.

2. **What does it measure?**
   The P/E ratio reflects the market’s **expectations** and **premium** for a company. For example, if a stock has a P/E of **20×**, it means investors are willing to purchase the stock at 20 times the company’s annual earnings.

3. **What is it used for?**
   It serves as a quick “thermometer” to help you judge whether the market is currently valuing the company too high or too low, and whether investors are **optimistic** (high P/E) or **conservative** (low P/E) about its future growth prospects.

## How Is the P/E Ratio Calculated?

The P/E ratio calculation is very straightforward. It compares the price you pay for one share to the annual earnings that share represents.

**Formula:**

$$\text{P/E Ratio} = \frac{\text{Price Per Share}}{\text{Earnings Per Share (EPS)}}$$

**What the result means:**

* The result is usually expressed as a **“multiple”**, such as 20×.
* This multiple reveals how the market values the company’s profits. For example, a P/E of **20×** means:

  * You are paying **20 times** the company’s annual earnings per share.
  * If earnings were to stay constant, the company would theoretically need **20 years** to earn back the amount you paid for the stock.

A higher P/E means investors are willing to pay a higher premium for each unit of the company’s profits.



## What Is Earnings Per Share (EPS)?

**Earnings Per Share (EPS)** measures a company’s profitability **on a per-share basis**.

* **Purpose:** It helps investors understand how much profit each share of stock actually represents, given the company’s total number of shares.
* **Principle:** In general, companies with **higher EPS** have stronger per-share profitability. However, EPS is not an absolute measure of total profits; it is measured **per share**.

The EPS formula subtracts preferred dividends (if any) from net income and divides the remainder by the total number of outstanding shares:

$$\text{EPS} = \frac{\text{Net Income} - \text{Preferred Dividends}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}}$$

* **Net Income:** Also called **profit** or **earnings**, it is the company’s total profit after all expenses.
* **Data sources:** You can find the necessary net income and outstanding share counts in the company’s latest annual or quarterly financial statements, or through financial websites like Yahoo Finance.



### Why EPS Matters to Investors

EPS is a **standardized metric** used to compare profitability across companies—even if they differ greatly in total revenue, total profit, or share count.

**Example:**

If Company A earns $4M profit with 300k shares, and Company B earns $50M with 6M shares:

* A’s EPS: $4,000,000 / 300,000 = **$13.33**
* B’s EPS: $50,000,000 / 6,000,000 = **$8.33**

**Conclusion:**
Despite B’s much higher total profits, A has a **higher EPS**, meaning each share represents more profit for investors.



### Factors That Affect EPS Over Time

EPS changes over time due to:

**1. Company Profits**

* **Higher profits:** EPS goes **up** (if share count unchanged).
* **Lower profits:** EPS goes **down**.

**2. Shares Outstanding**

* **Issuing new shares:** EPS goes **down** because profits are spread over more shares.
* **Stock buybacks:** EPS goes **up** because profits are spread over fewer shares. Buybacks are often used for this reason.

EPS is only one of many indicators investors should use, and it should be used alongside other financial metrics.



## Different Types of EPS

Based on **time period** and **method of calculation**, EPS has several variants.

### Variants Based on Time Period

| EPS Type                             | Meaning                                                              | Purpose & Significance                                                                      |
| :----------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **TTM EPS** (Trailing Twelve Months) | Profits from the **past 12 months**                                  | Most commonly used; best for calculating **real, historical P/E**. Reliable and up-to-date. |
| **Annual EPS**                       | Profits from the **last full fiscal year**                           | Commonly seen in official financial statements; may lag behind TTM.                         |
| **Forward EPS**                      | **Estimated profits for the next 12 months** or upcoming fiscal year | Used for **Forward P/E**, reflecting market expectations about future growth.               |

If a company has a high stock price but a **much lower Forward P/E** than Trailing P/E, the market likely expects strong profit growth soon.



### Variants Based on Calculation Method

These appear in official company filings and reflect calculation rigor.

| EPS Type        | Meaning                                                                           | Investor Significance                                                                       |
| :-------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Basic EPS**   | Uses the **actual number of shares currently outstanding**                        | A straightforward measure of profitability.                                                 |
| **Diluted EPS** | Assumes all dilutive securities convert into common stock, increasing share count | More conservative and more important; prevents investors from overestimating profitability. |

**Unless otherwise noted, investors should rely on Diluted EPS (TTM)** for analysis.


## Case Study: Palantir

![palantir-pe-ratio](palantir-pe-ratio.png)

### 1. EPS (TTM): Profitability Base

**EPS (TTM) $0.43** means:

* **Profit basis:** Over the **past 12 months**, Palantir earned **$0.43 per share**.
* **Meaning:** The company is profitable, but $0.43 is a very small amount compared to its stock price.


### 2. P/E Ratio (TTM) 391.74: Interpretation

A P/E ratio of **391.74×** is *extremely high*.

A nearly 400× multiple means one or both of the following:

1. **Profits are very small:**
   A low EPS (like $0.43) makes the denominator small, driving P/E very high.

2. **The stock price is very high:**
   Because investors expect enormous future growth.

For Palantir, **both** are usually true.


### Market Expectations Behind 391× P/E

No investor actually expects to “earn back” their investment in 391 years.

A P/E this high tells us:

| Observation            | Meaning                                                                                                                                                 |
| :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Extremely high P/E** | The market expects **very rapid future profit growth**.                                                                                                 |
| **Pricing logic**      | Investors are paying based on **future** earnings, not the $0.43 earned in the past 12 months.                                                          |
| **Positioning**        | The market sees Palantir as a **high-risk, high-growth** AI/data analytics platform with strong government contracts and large-scale commercial upside. |


### Summary: High Expectations, High Risk

* **Current state:** Palantir is profitable (EPS > 0).
* **Market sentiment:** Extremely optimistic; a 391× P/E implies massive growth is already priced in.
* **Risk:** If Palantir fails to meet these high expectations, the stock may face significant downside.

Investors are not buying Palantir for its current earnings—they are buying **belief in its disruptive technology and future dominance**.


## P/E Value and Payback Time: Do Investors Really Wait That Long?

**No.**
Investors do **not** buy high-P/E stocks expecting to “wait 20–30 years” to recoup their investment.
Payback period is a **theoretical explanation**, not an investment expectation.

Two core reasons investors accept high P/E:

### 1. Profit Growth Expectations

High-P/E stocks are **growth stocks**.

The assumption behind “30 years payback” is that earnings stay **constant**.
But if earnings grow 20% per year, actual payback time becomes much shorter.

### 2. The Goal Is Capital Appreciation

Most investors buy stocks to **sell them later at a higher price**, not to wait decades for profits.

* If the company succeeds, the stock price rises.
* Future investors pay even higher prices.
* Early investors profit.

Thus, high P/E represents **confidence in future performance**, not willingness to wait.


## How to Interpret High or Low P/E Ratios

**The P/E Ratio cannot be compared directly. It has very strict prerequisites and proper methods.**

Directly comparing the P/E ratios of different companies can easily lead to incorrect investment conclusions.

### Prerequisites for Comparing P/E Ratios

A P/E Ratio is only meaningful for comparison when one or both of the following conditions are met:

#### 1. The companies must be in the same industry (the most important condition)

This is the most critical restriction. You must compare “apples to apples”—you cannot compare a tech company with an energy company.

* **Reason:** Different industries have drastically different **growth rates, risk profiles, and capital structures**.

  * **Technology/Growth stocks** (e.g., software services): Often have very high growth expectations, so the market is willing to pay **high P/E multiples** (such as 40×).
  * **Utilities/Mature companies** (e.g., electric power companies): Their growth is stable and slow, with low risk, so the market only pays **low P/E multiples** (such as 15×).
* **Conclusion:** If a tech stock has a P/E of 30 and a utility company also has a P/E of 30, the meanings are completely different.

#### 2. The companies must be in similar stages of their business lifecycle

Even within the same industry, an early-stage, fast-growing company (reinvesting heavily, likely to have a high P/E) should not be directly compared with a company whose market has already matured (with stable cash flow and likely a lower P/E).

### Proper Methods of Comparing P/E Ratios

P/E comparison is mainly used through the following two analytical approaches:

#### 1. Peer Comparison

This is the most common method, used to determine whether a company is **overvalued or undervalued** relative to its industry peers.

* **Steps:**

  1. Select the target company (Company A).
  2. Identify 3–5 comparable companies with similar business models, scale, and market position.
  3. Calculate the average P/E of Company A and all peers.
* **Interpretation:**

  * If Company A’s P/E is **much higher** than the industry average, it usually means the market expects Company A’s future growth to be **significantly faster** than its competitors.
  * If Company A’s P/E is **much lower** than the industry average, it may mean the company is **undervalued**, or the market has concerns about its future profitability.

#### 2. Historical Comparison

This method determines whether a company’s **own current valuation** is relatively high or low.

* **Steps:**

  1. Collect the company’s P/E data from the past **5 or 10 years**.
  2. Calculate the company’s historical average P/E.
* **Interpretation:**

  * If the company’s current P/E is **lower** than its historical average, it may indicate that the stock is relatively cheap now.
  * If the company’s current P/E is **higher** than its historical average, it may indicate that the stock is relatively expensive.


In short: The P/E Ratio is a powerful tool, but it must be used in the **correct context** (same industry or the company’s own history) to produce meaningful conclusions.
At the same time, high or low P/E ratios must be evaluated together with **earnings growth expectations**.
A high P/E often reflects the market’s strong confidence and pricing based on future high growth, while a low P/E may indicate slow or stagnant growth.
