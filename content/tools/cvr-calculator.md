## What is CVR?

CVR stands for **Conversion Rate** — it tells you how many people took a desired action (like buying a product or signing up) after clicking on your ad or landing on your site. It’s a key metric for measuring how effective your marketing is at driving real results.



## What is the formula for CVR?

The formula is simple:
**CVR = (Conversions ÷ Clicks) × 100%**
So, if 10 out of 100 visitors convert, your CVR is 10%.



## What’s a good CVR?

A “good” CVR depends heavily on your industry, product, and audience. In general:

* **2%–5%** is common in eCommerce
* **10%+** is excellent in high-intent lead gen (like real estate or finance)
  The key is to track your **own baseline** and focus on improving it.



## Why is my average CVR so low?

There could be many reasons, but common ones include:

* Poor ad targeting
* Weak landing page or offer
* Slow website speed
* Lack of trust signals (like reviews or guarantees)
  Even small friction points can dramatically reduce conversions.



## How does CVR differ from CTR (Click-Through Rate)?

CTR measures **interest** — how many people clicked your ad.
CVR measures **action** — how many of those clickers actually converted.
In short: CTR gets them in the door; CVR shows if they stayed and bought.



## What factors affect CVR the most?

* **Audience relevance**
* **Offer clarity and value**
* **Landing page experience (speed, design, trust)**
* **Ease of conversion (forms, checkout, etc.)**
* **Device and platform (mobile vs desktop)**
  Every click is a potential customer — the smoother the journey, the better the CVR.



## How does CVR vary across industries or platforms?

Yes, and by a lot. For example:

* Google Search Ads often have higher CVR (due to intent)
* Facebook Ads tend to have lower CVR but broader reach
* eCommerce CVRs are usually lower than niche B2B lead gen
  Always compare within your industry, not across it.



## What is the difference between CVR and ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)?

* **CVR** is a performance metric: how many people converted.
* **ROAS** is a profitability metric: how much revenue you made per dollar spent.
  You can have a high CVR but poor ROAS if your conversions aren’t profitable.



## What are common mistakes that hurt CVR?

* Sending traffic to a generic homepage
* Asking for too much info too soon
* Poor mobile experience
* No clear CTA (Call to Action)
* Mismatched messaging between ad and landing page
  Each of these can break trust or create friction — both CVR killers.



## Does A/B testing help with CVR optimization?

Absolutely. A/B testing lets you compare different versions of your ad, landing page, or CTA to see what drives more conversions. Over time, these small tweaks can lead to big lifts in CVR.



## How does landing page design affect CVR?

Landing page design is huge. Clean layouts, fast load times, clear value props, strong CTAs, and trust elements (testimonials, badges) can all boost CVR. Clutter, confusion, or slow speed? That’ll kill it.
