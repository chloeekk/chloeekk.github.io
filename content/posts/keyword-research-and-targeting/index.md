## What is keyword research and targeting

### The meaning of keyword research

Keyword research refers to finding common words or phrases used by users in search engines through systematic analysis and data mining. This process helps websites or brands understand the search habits of potential audiences and identify high-potential keywords related to their business or products.

Keywords are not just single words, they can be phrases, sentences, or even questions. For example, users may search for "best coffee machine recommendation" or "how to choose a coffee machine." By studying these search phrases, we can understand user needs and create content that matches them.

### The meaning of keyword targeting

Keyword targeting is to apply the results of keyword research to websites or advertisements to ensure that these keywords appear effectively in appropriate locations to attract the attention of search engines and convert them into valuable traffic. Keyword targeting is not just piling up keywords on the website, but accurately selecting appropriate keywords and reasonably distributing them in important locations such as content, titles, meta descriptions, and URLs.

In SEO (search engine optimization), keyword targeting directly affects the ranking of a website. Search engines will judge the relevance of keywords used in the website content to the user's search intent based on the keywords used. If a website's keyword targeting is accurate and highly consistent with the user's search needs, it has a better chance of appearing on the first page of search results.

Keyword targeting can also help ads reach target users more accurately. For example, in Google Ads, keywords determine which users the ad will be shown to. Through accurate keyword targeting, marketers can ensure that ads appear in front of those who are truly interested, thereby increasing conversion rates.

## Types of keywords

Keywords play different roles in SEO and SEM strategies. Based on their length, purpose, and user intent, keywords can be divided into multiple types. Understanding these types can help you select and target keywords more effectively to maximize traffic and conversion rates.

### Short-tail keywords vs long-tail keywords

**Short-tail keywords** (Short-tail Keywords), usually composed of 1 to 2 words, cover a wide range and have a large search volume. For example, "coffee machine" is a typical short-tail keyword. This type of keyword can attract a lot of traffic in SEO, but because they are too general, the competition is very fierce and it is difficult to accurately meet the user's search intent. In addition, short-tail keywords may result in higher CPCs in SEM advertising because many competitors are competing for these popular keywords.

On the other hand, **Long-tail Keywords** usually contain 3 to 5 words, with a more specific search scope, relatively small search volume, but high conversion rate. For example, "home automatic coffee machine recommendation" is a long-tail keyword. Due to the clear search intent, users who use long-tail keywords are usually in the final stage of purchase decision. Such keywords have less competition in SEO and are more likely to gain ranking advantages. In SEM, the CPC of long-tail keywords is also usually lower, which means that companies can get higher conversion rates at a lower cost.

**Summary**: Short-tail keywords are suitable for increasing brand awareness in SEO or for large-scale exposure for brand promotion in SEM. Long-tail keywords are more suitable for attracting high-intent users, especially in SEM, which can help companies accurately target customers in the purchase stage.

### Branded Keywords vs Non-Branded Keywords

**Branded Keywords** contain brand names or words directly related to the brand. For example, "Starbucks coffee beans" is a branded keyword. Branded keywords are often used by existing customers or people who already have some knowledge of the brand, so these keywords have a higher conversion rate. In SEO, branded keywords help increase the brand's natural traffic, while in SEM, they can protect the brand from competitors' branded keyword bidding attacks through advertising.

**Non-branded keywords** do not contain brand names, but describe a type of product, service or problem. For example, "high-quality coffee beans" is a non-branded keyword. Searchers for this type of keyword are usually in the exploration stage and have not yet locked on to a specific brand. This means that non-branded keywords are more suitable for attracting new customers, especially in SEO, where it can cover a wider range of potential users. In SEM, non-branded keywords help brands enter new markets and attract potential customers who have not yet been exposed to the brand.

**Summary**: Branded keywords are suitable for strengthening brand loyalty and defensive marketing, while non-branded keywords help brands open up new markets and attract potential customers. The combination of the two can effectively balance short-term conversions and long-term brand building.

### Transactional Keywords vs Informational Keywords

Transactional Keywords are keywords used when users are planning to take an action, and usually include words such as "buy", "order", "offer", etc. For example, "buy coffee machine discount" is a transactional keyword. This type of keyword is particularly suitable for SEM advertising because users are close to the purchase stage and have high conversion potential. In SEO, transactional keywords can also be used on product pages or promotional content to attract users who are ready to buy.

Informational Keywords are keywords used when users are seeking information, solutions, or knowledge. Common search terms include "how to", "what is", "guide", etc. For example, "how to clean a coffee machine" is an informational keyword. Informational keywords are particularly important in SEO because they attract users who are researching or learning about a topic and build brand trust by providing valuable content. Although the conversion rate of these keywords may not be as high as that of transactional keywords, they are a key entry point to guide potential customers into the sales funnel. In SEM advertising, informational keywords can increase brand authority and visibility through display ads or content recommendations.

**Summary**: Transactional keywords have the ability to directly drive conversions in SEM advertising, while informational keywords are suitable for content marketing in SEO, helping brands build influence in the user research stage. The combination of the two can cover the entire process from information exploration to final decision-making.


## Important reference indicators for keyword research and targeting

When conducting keyword research and targeting, choosing the right keywords depends not only on their relevance, but also on a series of key indicators to judge the value of these keywords. The following indicators are essential for evaluating the feasibility of keywords and their application in SEO and SEM.

#### Search Volume

**Search volume** refers to the average number of searches for a keyword in a certain period of time. This indicator can give you an idea of ​​the demand for a specific topic or product. Keywords with high search volume usually bring more traffic, but it also means more competition.

In **SEO**, high-search volume keywords can help increase the exposure of the website, but be aware that these words are often highly competitive and not easy to rank quickly. Low-search volume long-tail keywords, although they have fewer searches, can bring more interested users due to their accuracy. In **SEM**, search volume is equally important. High-search volume keywords can help ads get more exposure opportunities, but if the budget is limited, you can consider choosing keywords with moderate search volume and relatively less competition to get a higher return on investment (ROI).

**Summary**: Search volume is the basic measure of keyword potential. High-volume keywords help improve visibility, while low-volume long-tail keywords help target high-converting, accurate traffic.

#### Keyword Difficulty

Keyword Difficulty (also known as keyword competition) measures how difficult it is to rank for a keyword in search engines, usually based on the authority and content quality of other competing websites. Keywords with higher difficulty are usually occupied by big brands in the industry, and SEOs need to invest more resources to rank for these keywords.

In SEO, keyword difficulty can help you decide which keywords to attack first. For new sites or sites with lower authority, choosing long-tail keywords with lower difficulty may be a more effective strategy because they have less competition and can bring higher ranking opportunities. In SEM, although keyword difficulty does not directly affect the display of ads, it is closely related to the cost per click (CPC) of ads - highly competitive keywords tend to have higher bids.

**Summary**: Keyword difficulty determines the difficulty of ranking in SEO and also affects the intensity of ad bidding in SEM.

#### Conversion Rate and Click-Through Rate (CTR & Conversion Rate)

**Click-Through Rate** (CTR) indicates the proportion of ads or search results that are clicked, while **Conversion Rate** (Conversion Rate) measures how many clicks ultimately lead to the expected behavior (such as purchases, registrations, etc.). These two indicators are one of the core criteria for measuring keyword quality.

In **SEO**, CTR is an important ranking factor. Search engines judge the relevance of a result to the search intent based on how often users click on a search result. Therefore, optimizing page titles and meta descriptions and increasing the click-through rate of keywords can indirectly improve search rankings. The conversion rate helps evaluate whether a keyword can bring valuable traffic - a high click-through rate but a low conversion rate may mean that the keyword attracts irrelevant traffic.

In **SEM**, CTR and conversion rate are equally important. CTR affects the quality score of an ad, which in turn affects the ad placement and click cost. The conversion rate is the core of evaluating the return on investment of keywords, helping you optimize your advertising budget and invest more resources in high-conversion keywords.

**Summary**: Keywords with high CTR and high conversion rates can bring more valuable traffic, and both SEO and SEM need to continuously optimize for these indicators.

#### Competition intensity (natural competition vs paid competition)

**Competition intensity** refers to the degree of competition for a keyword in natural search (SEO) and paid search (SEM). It measures how many websites or advertisers are competing for the same keyword.

In **SEO**, organic competition measures how many websites are optimizing for a keyword. If the top-ranking websites have strong domain authority (such as big brands or industry leaders), it will be difficult for new websites or websites with lower weight to surpass these competitors in the short term. In **SEM**, paid competition means that there are more advertisers bidding for display ads. Highly competitive keywords usually lead to higher advertising costs (CPC), especially in Google Ads, where the bids for keywords with high competition intensity can be very high.

**Summary**: Competition intensity determines whether you can get rankings in SEO in the short term, and also affects the bidding strategy and budget allocation of SEM ads.

#### Keyword Bid Estimate (Applicable to SEM)

In **SEM**, **Keyword Bid Estimate** refers to the cost per click (CPC) you are willing to pay for displaying your ads. The higher the bid, the greater the chance of your ad being displayed, especially for highly competitive keywords. But high bids do not always mean high returns. The quality of keywords and the relevance of ads are also crucial.

Platforms such as Google Ads often provide bid suggestions to help advertisers understand the average CPC of a keyword. If you are targeting high-converting keywords, being willing to pay a higher bid may bring more display and click opportunities. However, if the keyword bid is too high and the return is insufficient, you need to adjust your strategy and choose keywords that can balance cost and conversion rate.

**Summary**: Keyword bid estimation is a key element in SEM to ensure ad display. Advertisers need to flexibly adjust their bidding strategies based on budget and ROI to avoid unnecessary high cost investment.

## Keyword Research Methods

### How to Find Keywords
#### 1. Use tools to obtain data

Keyword research tools are an indispensable tool in SEO and SEM strategies. Through these tools, you can get a lot of data about keywords, including search volume, keyword difficulty, relevance and other indicators.

- **Google Keyword Planner**: This is a free tool provided by Google Ads, designed for SEM, but it can also provide basic keyword data for SEO. It helps you view the average monthly search volume, competition intensity and bid range (CPC) of keywords, so that you can better choose keywords for paid advertising.

- **Ahrefs, SEMrush and Moz**: These are professional SEO tools that can dig deep into keywords and provide data such as competition analysis, keyword difficulty, backlink analysis, etc. You can also view the keyword rankings of competitor websites and use these tools to find high-ranking keywords to optimize your content or ads.

- **Answer the Public**: This is a very useful tool that can generate a large number of long-tail keywords related to user questions and search intent based on keywords, which is particularly suitable for content creation and SEO optimization.

With these tools, you can not only find keywords related to your business, but also analyze the potential performance of each keyword, including the intensity of user demand, competition status and expected conversion rate.

#### 2. Use the autocomplete and related searches of search engines

Search engines themselves are powerful keyword research tools. By observing the autocomplete and related search results of search engines such as Google, you can find many common search terms used by users.

- **Autocomplete**: When you enter a word in the Google search box, the system will automatically complete common related search terms based on the user's search history and trends. For example, when you enter "coffee machine", Google may automatically complete it as "coffee machine recommendation", "how to choose a coffee machine", etc. These prompts not only reflect the common search terms of users, but also help you dig out new long-tail keywords, which are suitable for SEO content creation and SEM advertising targeting.

- **Related searches**: At the bottom of the Google search results page, recommended search terms related to the current search are usually displayed. For example, if you search for "buy coffee machine", you may see related search suggestions such as "best home coffee machine" and "coffee machine evaluation". These keywords can be used as new optimization directions, especially when you are looking for complementary or alternative keywords, these suggestions are very valuable resources.

With these free resources, you can discover more long-tail keywords and user search trends to help you optimize SEO content and SEM advertising.

#### 3. Analyze competitor keywords

Competitor keyword strategies are a valuable source of information. By analyzing the keywords they use, you can better understand market dynamics and user needs.

- **Tool Analysis**: Using tools such as Ahrefs and SEMrush, you can enter your competitor's website domain name to see the keywords they are ranking for, the pages that get traffic, and their advertising strategies. This not only helps you discover new keywords, but also evaluates which words are most helpful for their SEO and SEM strategies.

- **Manual Analysis**: You can also analyze competitors directly through Google search. For example, enter the keywords you want to rank for, see which competitors rank high, and analyze their page structure, content strategy, and keyword usage. This analysis can help you discover opportunities that they have overlooked, and can also guide you to develop stronger keyword optimization and bidding strategies.

### How to choose keywords

When choosing keywords, you need to develop a strategy based on the platform (SEO or SEM) and the user's search intent. Keyword classification has been discussed earlier, and this section will focus on how to actually apply these categories.

#### 1. Matching user intent: informational keywords vs conversion keywords

As we discussed earlier, keywords can be divided into two categories: informational and conversion. When choosing keywords, the most important thing is to match them according to the user's **search intent**:

- **Informational keywords**: Suitable for users in the exploration stage, such as search terms such as "how to choose a coffee machine". These keywords are usually suitable for SEO content strategies, and you can attract users' attention and improve page rankings by creating detailed guides, tutorials, or blog posts.

- **Conversion keywords**: These keywords are usually closer to the purchase decision stage and are suitable for SEM advertising. For example, words such as "buy a home coffee machine" or "coffee machine discounts" usually lead to direct conversions. Choosing conversion keywords can help increase the click-through rate (CTR) and conversion rate of ads.

**Summary**: Matching keywords according to user search intent is the first priority in keyword selection. Informational keywords are suitable for content marketing in SEO, while conversion keywords are more effective in SEM advertising.

#### 2. SEO: Keyword selection based on content type and user search intent

In SEO, keyword selection should match the goals of the content and the needs of users:

- **Long-tail keywords**: These more specific and segmented keywords usually have lower search volumes, but because they are more accurate, they can attract specific target groups and bring high-quality traffic. For example, for the search term "beginner coffee machine recommendation", you can attract users by creating a detailed product review or guide. Long-tail keywords are more suitable for long content such as blog posts and product reviews.

- **Short-tail keywords**: Short-tail keywords have higher search volumes, but competition is also very fierce. They are usually used for broad pages such as website homepages or product category pages. This type of keyword requires long-term optimization and is suitable for websites with greater demand for traffic and visibility.

- **Content-keyword relevance**: Make sure the selected keywords are closely related to the theme of the content. For example, if you are writing an article about a guide to choosing a coffee machine, using keywords like "coffee machine types" may improve the relevance and ranking of the article. On the contrary, using irrelevant keywords will affect SEO results.

**Summary**: In SEO, keyword selection should be combined with user search intent and content type. Long-tail keywords are more suitable for attracting precise traffic, while short-tail keywords are suitable for increasing broad awareness.

#### 3. SEM: Select high-conversion keywords based on advertising goals and budget

In SEM advertising, the goal of keyword selection is to increase the **click-through rate (CTR)** and **conversion rate (Conversion Rate)** of the advertisement. Here are some optimization strategies:

- **High-conversion keywords**: When choosing keywords for paid advertising, conversion rate is the most critical factor. Choosing keywords that are directly related to user purchasing behavior, such as "buy coffee machine online" or "coffee machine discounts", can improve the conversion effect of advertising. The conversion tracking function in Google Ads can help you understand which keywords bring the most conversions and focus your advertising budget on these high-efficiency words.

- **Match type**: Choose the appropriate keyword match type based on your advertising goals and budget. **Broad match** is suitable for advertising strategies with large budgets and the desire to reach a wider audience, but it may bring some inaccurate traffic. **Exact match** is more suitable for precise advertising, ensuring that ads are only displayed to specific target groups.

- **Budget management**: When the budget is limited, give priority to keywords with low competition intensity but high conversion potential. Using Google Ads' bidding strategy tool can help you estimate the cost per click (CPC) of each keyword, so as to optimize advertising spending and put more budget on keywords with higher conversion rates.

**Summary**: Keyword selection in SEM should be conversion-oriented, and a higher return on advertising investment (ROI) can be achieved through reasonable matching types and budget management.

### How to locate keywords

Keyword targeting is an important step in SEO and SEM optimization. It determines the layout of keywords on the page and the accuracy of advertisements. Different platforms and strategies have different requirements for keyword targeting. Below we will discuss in detail how to effectively locate keywords in SEO and SEM.

#### 1. SEO: Layout of keywords in page structure, title, meta description, and URL

In **SEO**, the reasonable layout of keywords can improve the search engine friendliness of the web page and help the web page rank higher in relevant searches. The following key positions need special attention in SEO optimization:

- **Title Tag**: The title tag is one of the most important SEO elements of a web page, which directly affects the display of the web page in search engine results. Make sure to put the core keywords in the first half of the title tag, which is beneficial to improve the relevance of the page and attract users to click. For example, if your keyword is "Best Coffee Machine", then the title can be "Best Coffee Machine Recommendation: Most Popular Models in 2024".

- **Meta Description**: Although the meta description itself does not directly affect the page ranking, it is crucial to improve the click-through rate (CTR). By cleverly embedding keywords in the meta description, you can enhance the attractiveness of the page and increase the possibility of users clicking. For example, "Looking to buy a coffee machine for home use? We have the best options for you in 2024."

- **URL**: When optimizing the URL, make sure it is concise and contains the main keywords of the page. Search engines prefer to display URLs with clear structure and relevant content. For example, using a URL like `example.com/best-coffee-machines` can improve the ranking of the page in searches related to coffee machines.

- **Page structure and content**: Incorporate keywords into the natural flow of the content, while being careful to avoid overstuffing. You can distribute keywords at the beginning of paragraphs, headings (H1, H2, etc.) and conclusions, which can not only increase the weight of keywords but also do not affect the user experience. In addition, internal links and alt tags of images are also good places for keyword layout.

**Summary**: Keyword targeting in SEO needs to focus on the reasonable layout of keywords in the page structure, ensuring that keywords can appear naturally in the title, meta description, URL and content to improve page relevance and user experience.

#### 2. SEM: Keyword matching types (broad match, phrase match, exact match) and ad targeting strategies

In **SEM** advertising, keyword targeting is closely related to the matching type of the ad. Different matching types can affect the accuracy and coverage of ad display. Common keyword matching types in Google Ads include **broad match**, **phrase match** and **exact match**, each of which is suitable for different advertising goals and budget strategies.

- **Broad Match**: This is the most relaxed matching type. Ads will be displayed in various searches related to the keyword, even if the user's search terms are not completely matched. For example, if the keyword you choose is "coffee machine", broad match may display ads in related searches such as "coffee pot" and "office coffee equipment". Broad match can help you reach a wider user base, but it may reduce the accuracy of the ad. Therefore, it is more suitable for advertisers with larger budgets who want to increase brand exposure.

- **Phrase Match**: Phrase match requires that the user's search terms contain your keyword phrase. The search results can include other words, but the order of the keyword phrases must be consistent. For example, when using phrase match "home coffee machine", the ad may appear in searches such as "buy home coffee machine" or "best home coffee machine brand". Phrase match provides greater control while maintaining a certain coverage, suitable for advertisers who want to balance precision and traffic.

- **Exact Match**: Exact match ensures that the ad is only displayed when the user searches for words that are exactly the same or very close to the keyword you set. For example, if your keyword is "home coffee machine", the ad will only be displayed when the user searches for "home coffee machine" or very close variants. Although the coverage of exact match is the narrowest, it ensures the accuracy of ad display and is suitable for advertisers with limited budgets and who want to increase conversion rates.

##### Ad Targeting Strategy

In SEM, in addition to the choice of keyword matching type, it is also necessary to develop a sophisticated ad targeting strategy to ensure that the ad is displayed to the most relevant audience:

- **Geographic location-based targeting**: By setting the geographic location, you can ensure that the ad is only displayed to users in a specific area. For example, a coffee machine retailer can choose to run ads only in a specific city or country, thereby increasing the conversion opportunities of local customers.

- **Device targeting**: Optimize ad display based on the devices used by different users (such as mobile devices, desktops, or tablets) to ensure that users can get the best browsing and shopping experience on different platforms.

- **Time period targeting**: Some businesses may have better conversion results during specific time periods, such as restaurant ads may be more effective during dinner time. By setting the ad display time period, you can improve the efficiency of budget use and optimize the effect of advertising.

**Summary**: In SEM advertising, the keyword matching type determines the accuracy and coverage of ad display. Advertisers need to flexibly choose the matching type based on their goals and budgets. At the same time, combining ad targeting strategies such as location, device, and time period can further improve the conversion rate and ROI of ads.

## How to find the best keywords for my website

Finding the best keywords is a key step in optimizing SEO and SEM results. For SEO, understanding user behavior data can help you optimize keyword selection, while for SEM advertising, A/B testing and conversion rate analysis can continuously adjust and optimize advertising keywords to improve results. Here are the specific methods:

### SEO: Optimize keyword selection through user behavior data

In SEO, keyword selection is not static. By analyzing user behavior data, you can continuously optimize keyword strategies to ensure that your website can continue to attract high-quality traffic.

- **Analyze website traffic data**: Use tools such as Google Analytics to analyze which keywords bring traffic to the website, which pages have low bounce rates and long user stay time. With this data, you can identify which keywords are bringing you high-quality visits and adjust your keyword strategy based on actual user behavior.

- **User search intent analysis**: As user search habits change, search engines will continue to adjust their algorithms, so it is important to regularly check the types of keywords users use during the search process. You can view user queries through Google Search Console to understand how users find your page, and adjust content and keywords to better match their search intent.

- **Use long-tail keywords to optimize content**: By analyzing user behavior data, you may find that users prefer to find your website through more specific search terms. At this time, using long-tail keywords can help you accurately match user needs. Long-tail keywords usually have less competition, but the conversion rate they bring is often higher, so regularly adding or adjusting long-tail keywords to your content can bring you stable traffic.

- **Page optimization and keyword position adjustment**: User behavior data can also help you identify which pages or content perform better than other parts. Based on this data, you can adjust the position of keywords, such as putting efficient keywords in the title, subtitle, and beginning of the page content to improve the performance of the page in search results.

### SEM: Optimize advertising keywords through A/B testing and conversion rate analysis

In SEM advertising, the choice of keywords directly affects the click-through rate and conversion rate of ads. By regularly conducting A/B testing and conversion rate analysis, you can continuously optimize advertising keywords to improve advertising effectiveness and ROI.

- **A/B test keywords**: With A/B testing, you can test different keyword combinations within the same ad group to see which keywords bring more clicks or higher conversion rates. For example, you can test "coffee machine purchase" and "cheap coffee machine" as different keyword combinations to see which keyword combination brings better conversion results. Based on the test results, you can focus your budget on the better-performing keywords to improve the efficiency of advertising.

- **Conversion rate analysis**: Don't just focus on clicks, but also analyze which keywords bring actual conversions. Using the conversion tracking feature in Google Ads, you can view the conversion rate of each keyword and optimize your ad group. By regularly analyzing conversion rates, you can find keywords that not only attract clicks, but also bring actual sales or other target conversions.

- **Adjust match type**: In SEM advertising, it is also important to choose the right keyword match type (broad match, phrase match, exact match). You can adjust the match type based on the results of the A/B test to see if certain keywords have a higher conversion rate under exact match, or if broad match brings more valuable traffic.

- **Optimize keyword bids**: By continuously monitoring ad performance, you can adjust bids based on keyword performance. For keywords with high conversion rates, consider increasing bids to increase display frequency and ad ranking. For keywords with poor performance, you can reduce budgets or suspend their use to avoid wasting advertising funds.
