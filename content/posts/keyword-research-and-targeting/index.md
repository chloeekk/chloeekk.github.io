## What Is Keyword Research and Targeting?

### Keyword Research: Understanding How Users Search

Keyword research refers to analyzing data to identify the words or phrases users commonly use in search engines. These keywords are often not just single words but **search phrases with clear intent**, such as:

* “Best coffee machine for small apartments”
* “High value laptops in 2025”
* “Which baby stroller brand is good”

Through keyword research, we can understand what potential users truly care about, their preferences, and how they express themselves, allowing us to create content that better fits their search habits. Good keyword research makes content more aligned with real searches and improves its chances of being recommended by search engines.

### Keyword Targeting: Helping Search Engines Better Understand Your Content

Keyword targeting involves **naturally embedding researched keywords into key areas of a page** to improve its visibility in search results. Keyword placement shouldn’t feel forced or repetitive — it should help both search engines and users clearly understand the page’s topic.

Keywords should typically appear in the following places:

* Page Title
* Paragraph openings
* URL
* Meta Description
* Image alt attributes
* Natural positions within the content

For example, when a user searches for “portable washing machine for renters,” and you offer a relevant product, then the page title, content, and description should clearly contain that phrase — rather than vaguely saying “washing machine recommendations.”

Precise keyword targeting not only helps search engines understand your content but also provides readers with the answers they’re looking for.

## Types of Keywords

Keywords play different roles in SEO and SEM strategies. Based on their length, purpose, and user intent, keywords can be categorized in several ways:

| **Classification**        | **Keyword Type**      | **Definition**                                                                                     | **Example (with 'coffee machine')**                                                      |

## How to Research Keywords?

With the rise of generative AI, many content creators and SEO professionals are rethinking a classic question: how should we do keyword research?

Traditional methods are mature—choose seed keywords, analyze search volume, expand long-tail terms, control keyword density... Clear processes, well-defined tools.

But today, users search differently—more conversationally, semantically, and unpredictably.

Let’s compare traditional keyword research with AI-driven approaches to highlight key differences:

| **Dimension**            | **Traditional Keyword Research**                                          | **AI-Driven Keyword Research**                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Starting Point**       | Based on **user behavior data** + seed keyword expansion                  | Based on **natural language input + semantic modeling** — AI can extract keyword networks and intent from a description          |
| **Expansion Mechanism**  | Rule-based suggestions or manual selection                                | Context-driven — generates question-style, conversational, scenario-based keywords                                               |
| **Analysis Dimensions**  | Focus on: search volume, competition, CPC, core/long-tail structure       | Adds: intent recognition, context relevance, tone, emotion, conversational style                                                 |
| **Keyword Structure**    | Flat structure: core + long-tail                                          | Semantic categories: “functional terms”, “question terms”, “negative intent terms”, “pain point phrases”, “scenario-bound terms” |
| **Generation Method**    | Based on user behavior/platform history, mostly static                    | Generated by LLMs — can propose high-potential, never-before-searched semantic combinations                                      |
| **Representative Tools** | Ahrefs, SEMrush, Google Keyword Planner, AlsoAsked, AnswerThePublic, etc. | Above + Frase, SEO.ai, ChatGPT (as prompt helper), WriterZen, NeuronWriter, Perplexity, etc.                                     |
| **Tool Capability**      | Requires keyword input to trigger suggestions                             | Can generate keywords based on goals or user intent, supports clustering and summarization                                       |
| **Content Integration**  | Keyword → Article structure (frequency, headers, paragraph distribution)  | User intent → Search journey → Content phrasing; emphasizes natural expression and semantic coverage                             |
| **Role Shift**           | Led by SEO specialist/content planner                                     | Content creator + AI operator jointly drive process                                                                              |
| **Coverage Efficiency**  | Long-tail keywords require manual effort or enumeration tools             | AI can **automatically generate rich semantic variations and user language versions**                                            |
| **Content Relevance**    | Focus on technical matches (frequency, density)                           | Focus on semantic fluency and intent fulfillment; emphasizes **naturalness, tone, and consistency**                              |


## How to Target Keywords?

Finding keywords is only the first step. What truly determines the effectiveness of your content is **how those keywords are used on the page**, and whether they accurately respond to user search intent. In the past, we relied on experience to control the placement and frequency of keywords. Today, AI is beginning to help us understand “what users actually want to see,” and naturally integrate keywords into content.

| **Dimension**               | **Traditional Keyword Targeting Method**                                                             | **AI-Driven Keyword Targeting Method**                                                                                                   |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Core Targeting Logic**    | Based on the **match between keywords and page content**, optimizing placement and frequency         | Based on the **alignment between user search intent and content semantics**, optimizing context and experience                           |
| **Keyword Distribution**    | Manually controlling keywords in **title, H-tags, first paragraph, paragraph leads, URL, meta desc** | AI automatically determines which **sections, tones, and question styles** keywords should appear in, aiming for natural flow            |
| **Page Matching Method**    | Keywords → Page Content (“writing around keywords”)                                                  | User Intent → Content → Related Keyword Clusters (“problem-solving centered”)                                                            |
| **Intent Adaptation**       | Intent behind keywords judged by experience, which may involve subjective bias                       | LLM models can identify **intent layers** (e.g., informational / comparative / transactional) and generate matching phrasing             |
| **User Search Path**        | Understanding needs in terms of keywords                                                             | Understanding needs by **search journey** (“learn → compare → choose → purchase”) and dynamically adjusting keyword layout               |
| **Content-Type Matching**   | One keyword per page; multiple landing pages to handle different keywords                            | Multi-intent pages; support for multiple keywords; AI can recommend modular structures (e.g., FAQ + product comparison + reviews)        |
| **Ad Targeting**            | Select keywords + bidding; match ad copy and landing pages                                           | AI can generate the most relevant keyword sets and copy based on ad goals and user intent (e.g., Performance Max + AI-generated visuals) |
| **Supported Content Forms** | Mainly for text-based pages                                                                          | Also supports **image-text, short video, voice** and other formats for multi-modal integration                                           |
