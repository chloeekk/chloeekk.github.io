The workplace and productivity environment kept changing quickly in 2023, with a sizable percentage of workers adopting remote or hybrid work arrangements. According to a Pew Research Center research, 59% of American workers who believe they can perform the majority of their work from home also work from home all or most of the time. 

A methodical approach to addressing the day's work is provided by timeboxing, which is the practice of assigning a predetermined amount of time to a particular task or activity before beginning. It aids in work prioritization as well as realistic boundary setting, which lowers the likelihood of burnout and improves work-life balance overall.
