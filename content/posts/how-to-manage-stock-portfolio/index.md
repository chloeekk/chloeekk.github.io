## Universal Philosophy of Investing

Whether engaging in low-cost index investing or high-intensity active speculation, the success of all market participants rests on a shared philosophical foundation.

### The Preparation Process for Trading

Investing and speculating are not driven by luck or impulse. They require the knowledge and discipline of a professional.

* **Acquire Knowledge**: Before committing money, you must commit time, money, and effort to learning how markets function, how to manage risk, and how to analyze assets. Without intellectual investment, sustained returns are impossible.
* **Professional Attitude**: Treat trading the same way you would treat professional matters (like consulting a doctor or engineer). Never commit large sums to a position or strategy you do not fully understand.

### Risk Awareness and Capital Preservation

Protecting your capital is the first priority of any trading activity.

* **Define Your Risk**: Each trade must begin with a clearly defined maximum loss you are willing to tolerate—and you must obey it strictly.
* **Avoid Overtrading**: Stick to conservative trading principles and avoid excessive buying and selling. Frequent trades increase error rates and amplify risks.
* **Protect Your Profits**: The key to success is to **always protect your capital**, never allowing existing paper gains to turn into losses due to greed or unrealistic expectations.

### Independent Judgment, Patience, and Discipline

Mental independence and patience distinguish long-term winners from the general public.

* **Independent Analysis**: Your decisions must be based on your own analysis of market trends and price charts—not on news, rumors, or market sentiment.
* **Contrarian Thinking**: The public often trades based on fear or hope. Successful traders must understand human nature and have the ability to **move against the crowd**.
* **The Principle of Patience**:

  * **Wait for the Right Moment**: Be patient and wait for the right setups. Do not enter or exit early due to anxiety. If the market has not shown a clear trend, stay on the sidelines.
  * **Hold Your Winners**: Once a position moves in your favor, hold it patiently until there are solid reasons—not just small temptations of profit—to close it.

### Error Correction and Self-Reflection

Success comes from recognizing and correcting mistakes quickly.

* **Admit Mistakes**: If a position begins moving against you, accept the small loss quickly and exit. Never throw more money at a losing position to **average down** or “hold on and hope.”
* **Strict Self-Review**: Examine every mistake seriously and identify the root cause of each loss. This prevents repeated errors.
* **Remove Biases**: View the market objectively. Do not exaggerate good or bad news, and guard against personal biases affecting your judgment.


## Path One (Investor): A Systematic Approach to Low-Cost, Long-Term Passive Investing

For most **long-term investors and beginners** who lack time or professional expertise, the core goal is to build a simple, stable, low-cost **passive investment system**, leveraging compounding over time to accumulate wealth.

### Selecting and Allocating Index Funds

#### What Is a Position?

A **position** refers to the **amount or share of an asset** an investor holds or commits to hold. It represents the capital you allocate to a particular investment (such as a fund, stock, or bond).

#### Why Index Funds Are the First Choice

Long-term investment success hinges on **minimizing costs** and **maximizing diversification**.

* **Low Expense Ratios**: Index funds track a market index and are passively managed, resulting in far lower fees than actively managed funds. Lower costs allow more of your returns to stay in your pocket.
* **Built-in Diversification**: Purchasing a **total market index fund** gives you immediate exposure to thousands of companies, effectively eliminating **individual stock risk**.

#### The Logic Behind Equal-Weight Positioning

The **equal-weight principle** requires allocating **roughly equal amounts of capital** to each asset when investing in multiple funds.
This prevents any single asset from dominating portfolio risk due to personal bias or emotional overconfidence. If you select three funds, you should allocate about 33.3% to each rather than allocating 80% to the one you “like most.”

### Beginner Portfolio Structures: Simple-to-Advanced Index Fund Models

Investors should select one of the three mainstream index structures based on **risk tolerance** and **investment horizon**—and then stick with it long term.

#### 1. The One-Fund Strategy

The simplest and most straightforward approach.

* **Structure**: **100% in a total market stock index fund** (domestic or global).
* **Characteristics**: Ultra-simple to manage, lowest cost, highest volatility. Over periods of 10+ years, compounding often yields the highest return potential.
* **Best For**: **Young investors** in the wealth-building phase with high risk tolerance and no short-term liquidity needs.

#### 2. The Two-Fund Strategy

This structure balances growth with stability.

* **Structure**: **Total stock market fund + bond fund**.
* **Rationale**: Bonds tend to be stable or rise during recessions or market panics, providing a **cushion** against equity volatility.
* **Allocation**: Determined by risk tolerance (e.g., 70% stock / 30% bond).
* **Best For**: Investors anxious about volatility or **approaching retirement** and needing capital protection.

#### 3. The Three-Fund Strategy

One of the most complete and robust models in index investing.

* **Structure**: **Domestic/US stock fund + bond fund + international stock fund**.
* **Rationale**: Adds **geographic diversification**, reducing dependence on any single economy.
* **Best For**: Investors seeking **maximum diversification** and believing in long-term global growth.

### Risk Management: A Systematic, Portfolio-Based Approach

Unlike active speculators who focus on specific price levels, long-term investors must prioritize **total portfolio protection**.

**Drawdown (DD)** refers to the decline from a portfolio’s **historical peak** to its **current low**. A peak of $10,000 dropping to $7,000 is a 30% drawdown.

#### The 1% Stop-Loss Rule (Capital Safety Floor)

No single position should ever be allowed to cause more than **1% of total portfolio loss**.
If a fund represents 10% of your assets, you should set a 10% stop-loss (10% loss × 10% allocation = 1%). This ensures that even a completely wrong investment decision causes only limited damage.

#### The 50% Profit Drawdown Rule (Defeating Greed)

Once you gain significant profits, **never allow more than 50% of those profits to evaporate**.
This forces you to lock in gains during corrections, ensuring that **profits never turn into losses**.

Example:

| Metric                                  | Data       | Description                    |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Initial Investment**                  | $10,000    | Your cost basis.               |
| **Peak Portfolio Value**                | $20,000    | Highest point reached.         |
| **Peak Paper Gain (A)**                 | $10,000    | $20,000 − $10,000 = $10,000.   |
| **Maximum Allowed Profit Drawdown (B)** | $5,000     | **A × 50%**.                   |
| **Value at Which You Must Sell (C)**    | $15,000    | $20,000 − $5,000.              |
| **Locked-In Profit**                    | **$5,000** | Guaranteed even after selling. |

### Rebalancing and Long-Term Commitment

* **Rebalancing**: Over time, different asset classes rise or fall unevenly, skewing your target allocation. You should **regularly** (annually or when allocations drift by more than 5%) **sell outperformers and buy underperformers** to restore balance—systematically “buying low and selling high.”
* **Long-Term Commitment**: Once you choose a strategy, you must commit to **long-term holding**. Passive investing relies on **compounding** and long-term market growth—not frequent trading. Maintaining discipline and ignoring short-term noise is essential for success.


## Path Two (Trader): Active Speculation Under the Gann System

Active speculation is not simple buying and selling. It requires **knowledge, discipline, and systematic analysis**. Traders must ignore the public’s emotional swings and rely solely on structured methods and data.

### Money Management and Risk Limitation

The Gann system centers on **capital protection**, treating risk the way a merchant manages costs.

#### 1. Absolute Rules for Limiting Risk

* **Point-Based Stop-Losses**: Each trade’s loss should be limited to **around 3 points**, **never exceeding 5**. This absolute constraint prevents small errors from becoming major losses.
* **Never Average Down**: If a trade moves against you, do not add more shares to “average down.” This is the worst mistake. Accept the small loss and exit—wait for the next precise setup.

#### 2. Asset Selection and Position Allocation

* **Choose Active Leaders**: Only trade **active, high-volatility leaders** with strong volume on major exchanges. Large price swings create profit opportunities; stagnant stocks do not.
* **Diversify**: Choose one stock from each category and trade four or five in total, with **equal share quantities** for each. This prevents over-concentration.

#### 3. The Decreasing-Size Pyramid Strategy

A key technique for building profit: **add positions only as profits grow—and reduce position size with each addition**.

* **Safety First**: The first buy (near the bottom or top) carries the biggest risk. As the stock moves in your favor (e.g., every 10-point rise), add new positions but **reduce position sizes** (e.g., 100 → 50 → 30 shares).
* **Goal**: Keep your average cost near the trend’s beginning so most profits are safely protected and late-stage additions do not jeopardize your gains.

### Market Reading: Time, Price, and Volume

Successful speculation depends on understanding **supply and demand dynamics**.

#### 1. Price and Time Cycles

* **Cycle Analysis**: Plot monthly, yearly, weekly, and daily movements to determine whether a stock has completed **accumulation** or **distribution**.
* **Trend Recognition**: Major accumulation or distribution phases often take **months or a year**. You need not watch the market every minute; focus on major trend shifts.

#### 2. Volume Analysis

* **Volume Is Energy**: Volume drives price movements. It must be evaluated in the context of the stock’s **total shares outstanding**.
* **Identifying Accumulation**: Near bottoms, if volume is very light but price begins to rise, it suggests **selling pressure has been exhausted** and accumulation is completing.
* **Identifying Distribution**: Near tops, if volume is heavy but price barely rises, the market has become **supply-heavy**, and insiders are unloading shares.

### Execution and Mental Discipline

* **Follow the Trend**: Identify the trend, then follow it. Accept losses quickly—this is a crucial skill.
* **Ability to Short**: Those who can only trade long will never succeed. Master **short selling** to profit during declines.
* **Take Profits Decisively**: Do not exit at the first small gain. But once you see distribution or a trend reversal, exit quickly—**don’t chase the last few points**.


## Advanced Risk Management: Hedging Beyond Diversification

Traditional diversification (e.g., the three-fund strategy) only protects against **unsystematic risk**. When facing **systemic risk**—recessions, geopolitical conflicts, inflation—more sophisticated hedging is required.

### Sector-Based Hedging

Sector hedging balances exposure to the economic cycle.

* **Core Idea**: Balance **cyclical sectors** with **defensive sectors** to maintain portfolio stability through expansions and recessions.
* **Cyclical Sectors**:

  * **Characteristics**: Strong in expansions, weak in recessions.
  * **Examples**: Tech, consumer discretionary, industrials, financials.
* **Defensive Sectors**:

  * **Characteristics**: Stable demand regardless of economic conditions; resilient in downturns.
  * **Examples**: Healthcare, utilities, consumer staples.

> Allocating defensive sector funds or ETFs helps cushion losses during economic downturns.

### Geopolitical Hedging

Geopolitical risk includes war, trade conflict, and deteriorating relationships among major nations. These risks affect entire regions and cannot be addressed by simple stock diversification.

* **Core Idea**: Hold assets with **low correlation** to major economies as hedges during global shocks.
* **Deeper Geographic Diversification**:

  * Ensure your **international stock** allocation includes **emerging markets**, not just developed nations. Their behavior may be less synchronized with developed markets during geopolitical events.
* **Add Safe-Haven Assets**:

  * **Gold**: A traditional **hard asset** and hedge that often rises during inflation scares or geopolitical instability. Gold ETFs are a simple way to gain exposure.
  * **Other Commodities**: For instance, energy commodities like oil may hedge risks associated with Middle East tensions.
  * **Currency Hedging**: Investors holding large foreign assets may use currency tools to hedge depreciation risks.

> Geopolitical hedging ensures that when the worst occurs, part of your portfolio holds value or even performs counter-cyclically.
