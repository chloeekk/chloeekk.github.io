A Google Ads Specialist is a professional who specializes in creating, managing, and optimizing digital advertising campaigns on the Google Ads platform. Specialists are responsible for creating effective campaigns that meet the specific needs of their clients. They must develop strategies to drive traffic to websites, increase brand awareness, and generate leads and sales.

## Background
After graduation, I entered an Internet company responsible for overseas promotion, and after a year, I switched to be an overseas advertising specialist, and since then, I have started my road of Google advertising. I have pushed new products, been in charge of high net worth products, experienced the whole account being blocked, and recently started to learn to recruit competent subordinates. Although the market situation is not optimistic in these years, from my personal experience, from the perspective of salary and market demand, overseas advertising specialist is still a good career choice. I hope this article can provide some reference for those who are interested in the position of Google Ads specialist.

## Concept Discernment
- Does Google Ads Specialist require a high level of English?
In most cases, yes.

Generally companies with overseas advertising specialist positions have the need to go overseas, so foreign language skills are a certain ability that will be assessed. Usually the requirement is at least IELTS 7 level (if you have relevant experience, you may be able to relax the requirement), some of the more demanding companies will ask you the specific grade 6 score, if it is just over the passing line, it may also be seen as a minus. For students majoring in minor languages, minor languages will be a plus for you, but you must also pass the English level.

- Will Google Ad Specialist be very busy? Do you need to work overtime a lot?
If anyone has probably understood the position of overseas advertising specialist, they may have seen a lot of practitioners are discouraged to quit, citing "very serious overtime", "no personal time", "need to keep an eye on the account on holidays " and so on. It must be admitted that overtime is a relatively common situation for this position, but it cannot be generalized. According to my own situation and the situation of related practitioners around me, whether overtime and the intensity of overtime will be affected by the following two factors:
1. **Party A & B Company**

There is also a distinction between A and B party companies for overseas advertising.

Party A refers to companies that have self-developed products (games, software, physical products, etc.), and then hire specialized personnel to be responsible for overseas advertising of these products. A B-side company is a company that provides advertising management or consulting services for the A-side company, usually called an agency (advertising agency) in the industry.

In the vast majority of cases, the overtime of Party B staff will be much more serious. Because Party A staff is responsible for the entire company's product advertising accounts, while Party B staff usually have at least five clients' advertising accounts on hand, each client needs to promote a different number of products. I learned that one of the scarier figures is that there is an optimizer in Baidu who had more than 100 accounts in his hands.

So, obviously, don't go to a B-side company if you can find an A-side job.

When screening jobs and companies, it is actually easy to see whether the job belongs to the A-side or B-side. In the job postings appear similar to the words "advertiser", "advertisers", is basically the position of the second party company.


2. **Promoted product types**

The more common types of products are: games, software, physical products (such as clothing, shoes and socks, accessories, etc.). For software and physical products, there will also be a distinction between C- and B-sides. Generally speaking, the overtime intensity is as follows (look at toB or toC first, then product type)

C-side > B-side

Game > physical product (partial e-commerce) > software (non-game type)

The size and magnitude of change of advertising traffic and the degree of market competition determine the frequency and intensity of your overtime.

In addition, by the way, the overtime intensity of Google ad specialists is usually not as strong as that of Facebook ad specialists, because the algorithm mechanism of the two platforms is different, the latter has higher requirements for data continuity, and due to the existence of time differences, it usually requires the specialists to get up in the middle of the night to see if the account is abnormal.

- Is the Google Ad Specialist only responsible for Google channels? Can the experience be applied to other platforms?

Google Ads specialists are usually only responsible for Google channels, but some smaller companies may have one specialist responsible for multiple channels (e.g. Facebook, Tiktok, Instagram, etc.).

Regarding whether the experience can be reused, it needs to be judged according to different platform placement and algorithm mechanism. If it is directly benchmarked, the experience of Google ads can be directly reused in Bing ads, but it is definitely not feasible to put it in Facebook ads.

## Job Description
The daily work of Google Ads Specialist includes the following.

1. Monitor the changes of account traffic, expenses, sales, etc., and make timely adjustments according to data fluctuations to ensure account stability
2. Pay attention to the situation of competing products in the market, discover new traffic and sales expansion points, and establish new placement plans
3. Interface with other departments such as product, operation, design, etc. (e.g. docking of advertising material requirements, landing page design, website page troubleshooting, etc.)
4. Daily statistics and analysis (daily, weekly and monthly reports, etc.)

## Job Requirements
Google Advertising Specialist job requirements can actually be found in major recruitment software, I probably list here a few general requirements of the industry:

1. English Proficiency

The importance and necessity of English language skills for this position has been mentioned earlier. For the time being, English is still the most widely spoken language in the world, and advertisements in minor languages can only be placed for specific minor language regions. English majors are advised to provide certificates.

2. Data analysis ability

Data analysis here does not mean more advanced analysis ability such as SQL and modeling, but requires you to be sensitive enough to ad data and be able to make more reasonable decisions and operations by analyzing ad-related metrics. The definition of each data indicator in the account is different, but they are all related to each other before, how you find the reason of fluctuation, how to tell your analysis clearly, how to explain the account data anomaly and the corresponding solution to your superior, all require you to have certain data analysis thinking and ability.

3. Cross-team collaboration skills

Ad placement is not a position that can be done well alone. You need to be responsible for your own ad account data. After analyzing and troubleshooting, if the anomaly is not from the ad itself, but from a bug in the product, inaccessible web page, etc., you need to find the corresponding person in charge to troubleshoot and solve it.
