As the person in charge of online advertising for a market, facing the new quarterly KPI targets and advertising budget from your company, you need to ask yourself the following questions:
- What is the main focus of this quarter‚Äôs KPIs? Is it **scaling up**, **improving efficiency**, or **increasing customer value**?
- Compared with the previous quarter, what are the main changes in KPIs and market conditions? Which channels are facing a sharp increase in customer acquisition cost (CAC)?
- Do you think the KPI target is **achievable with the current budget**? Is the growth logic behind it reasonable?
- If you believe there‚Äôs a significant gap between targets and resources, how will you use **historical ROI data** to negotiate with leadership for more reasonable goals or resources? (Of course, in most cases, you‚Äôll still have to get it done with limited resources üòâ)
- Once the **final KPIs** are confirmed, how will you allocate this quarter‚Äôs ad budget to ensure the KPIs are met?

This article uses ‚Äúimproving customer quality‚Äù as an example to share a practical framework for ad budget allocation.

## 1. Understand Your KPIs

A well-designed quarterly KPI usually consists of **multiple metrics with different weights**, each reflecting the strategic emphasis of the business for that quarter.

Here‚Äôs a typical KPI combination that balances **quality and efficiency**:

| KPI | Weight | Focus | Strategic Meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Net new paying users** | 30% | Growth | Ensure market share and user base expansion |
| **Net revenue** | 20% | Total value | Ensure overall revenue performance |
| **Median net revenue** | 20% | Customer quality | Improve the value contribution of typical users and long-term LTV |
| **CAC for new paying users** | 30% | Cost efficiency | Keep acquisition costs under control and optimize ROI |

* **Metric clarification:** First, distinguish between ‚Äúnew‚Äù and ‚Äúnet new‚Äù metrics, and understand what each implies (e.g., net new typically factors in churn rate).
* **Goal interpretation:** Noting the inclusion of **‚Äúmedian net revenue‚Äù** and **‚Äúnew CAC‚Äù**, it‚Äôs clear this quarter isn‚Äôt about chasing volume. The focus is on **improving customer quality** while keeping costs under control.

## 2. Assess KPI Difficulty and Key Challenges

Before allocating budgets, you must answer two key questions: ‚ÄúWhere are the main challenges this quarter?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat new demands do these KPIs impose on existing channels?‚Äù

Compare the new KPIs with **last quarter‚Äôs actual results** to calculate the **required growth rate**‚Äîthese growth figures directly guide your allocation strategy.

For example:

| KPI | Change vs. last quarter | Challenge | Budget Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Net new paying users** | **-12%** | **Shrinking scale:** Market saturation, competition, or exhausted user pool | Find new high-potential channels or audiences |
| **Net revenue** | **+31%** | **Higher value target:** Despite smaller scale, total revenue must rise | Focus on **high-ticket, high-conversion** channels to improve ROI |
| **Median net revenue** | **+582%** | **Extremely high-quality demand:** Typical user value must soar | Concentrate budget on **core quality layers**, avoid low-value traffic |
| **New CAC** | **+28%** | **Cost pressure:** Slightly higher CAC is acceptable for high-value users | Invest in **premium traffic**, but **strictly control CAC** ceiling |

From this, we can see:

* **Structural shift:** It‚Äôs a **‚Äúquality-over-quantity‚Äù** quarter‚Äîyou must offset a **12% decline in scale** by acquiring **ultra-high-value users** (+582% median increase) to drive overall revenue.
* **Allocation challenge:** Budgets must shift from **quantity-focused channels** to **high-conversion channels**. The 28% CAC allowance is meant to buy **higher-value customers**.

## 3. Define Evaluation Metrics and Channel Adjustment Directions

Once you understand the quarter‚Äôs challenge, the next step is to establish a **consistent and actionable evaluation system**. Channels vary widely in **acquisition ability, cost efficiency, and customer quality**, so we need metrics that accurately evaluate them using **last quarter‚Äôs data** as the baseline.

While **net new users**, **net revenue**, and **new CAC** are comparable across sub-channels, **median net revenue** requires adjustment.

We introduce two derived metrics:

* **Median Net Revenue Premium %**
    * **Formula:** (Channel median net revenue ‚Äì Overall median) / Overall median * 100%
    * **Purpose:** Measures how much better a channel‚Äôs customer quality is compared to the overall average. The **higher the positive premium**, the more valuable the channel.

* **Median Net Revenue Gap %**
    * **Formula:** (Target median ‚Äì Channel median) / Target median * 100%
    * **Purpose:** Measures how far a channel‚Äôs user quality is from the target. A **higher positive value** means it‚Äôs lagging; a **negative value** means it‚Äôs outperforming the target.

These metrics reveal which channels are **high-value cash cows**, which are **low-quality money pits**, and which **have potential** to reach the goal with optimization.

But quality metrics alone aren‚Äôt enough. This quarter‚Äôs KPI is a **multi-dimensional balance**‚Äîwe must hit quality goals without sacrificing **scale** (net new users) or **cost control** (CAC).

* **The issue:** Some channels may deliver excellent customer quality but **tiny acquisition volume** and **high CAC**. Over-investing in them can wreck your other KPIs.
* **Balancing metric:** Introduce **% of new paying users**, defined as:  
  Channel‚Äôs new paying users / Total new paying users * 100%.

Here‚Äôs an example of key Q4 data that serves as the **foundation for budget allocation**:

| Channel | Premium % (Quality) | Gap % (Quality) | % of New Paying Users (Scale) | New User CAC (Cost) | **Initial Positioning** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bing** | +3890% | -1161% | 0.2% | $6 | **Super high quality, but very small scale** |
| **SEM** | +400% | -58% | 15% | $17 | **Consistently high quality, add cautiously** |
| **TikTok** | 0% | +68% | 22% | $8 | **Strong scale, needs quality improvement** |
| **ASA** | -50% | +53% | 16% | $10 | **Lower quality, cost advantage** |
| **UAC** | 0% | +68% | 31% | $14 | **Main driver for scale, needs quality lift** |
| **Meta** | 0% | +68% | 12% | $18 | **High cost, low scale, needs optimization** |

This table reveals the **core tension** in Q4 budget allocation:

* **Quality leaders** (SEM, Bing) offer exceptional users but limited volume (15.2% combined), with SEM‚Äôs CAC relatively high.
* **Scale leaders** (UAC, TikTok) provide volume but average customer quality (0% premium) and a 68% gap from Q4‚Äôs target.

Thus, **this quarter‚Äôs budget isn‚Äôt a simple math exercise‚Äîit‚Äôs strategic balancing**:  
Invest more in **high-quality channels** to hit ‚Äúmedian net revenue,‚Äù but reserve enough budget for **low-cost, high-scale channels** to stabilize CAC and net new user metrics.

## 4. Develop Channel Strategies

After completing **goal interpretation**, **difficulty assessment**, and **channel positioning** based on **quality, scale, and cost**, it‚Äôs time to turn this analysis into an **actionable plan**. This phase involves **cross-team collaboration and risk control**, not just math.

Before finalizing the **increase/decrease plan** for each channel, evaluate these four areas:

1. **Macro environment and external drivers**  
   Are there major **brand events, seasonal factors, or market trends** (e.g., policy changes, sector booms) that could enhance performance or lower costs? Account for these external boosts early in your planning.

2. **Retention and remarketing potential**  
   Can existing users (registered but unpaid, or low-frequency payers) be reactivated? Remarketing often delivers **higher-quality conversions at lower cost**. Reserve part of the budget for **retargeting and reactivation**.

3. **User experience and conversion funnel optimization**  
   Ads drive traffic, but are there bottlenecks in your **site/app conversion funnel**? Collaborate with product and operations teams to **improve UX** and indirectly **enhance ad conversion efficiency**.

4. **Feasibility and risk assessment of growth targets**  
   For channels needing **large volume or major quality improvement** (e.g., Bing, SEM), confirm with your channel managers that the traffic, cost, and optimization goals are **realistically achievable**.

## 5. Set Strategic Boundaries and Manage Risk

When planning your budget, always apply **risk management and bottom-line thinking**. In extreme cases, a KPI (like net revenue or median net revenue) may be **nearly impossible** to achieve‚Äîfor example, a tenfold increase.

In such cases, create **two budget scenarios**:

### Scenario 1: Aggressive Growth Plan (High Risk, High Reward)

* **Goal:** Concentrate resources on high-value channels to maximize ‚Äúmedian net revenue‚Äù and ‚Äúnet revenue.‚Äù
* **Effect:** Push for the most ambitious outcomes.

### Scenario 2: Baseline Protection Plan (Low Risk, Score Safety)

* **Goal:** Ensure overall KPI performance doesn‚Äôt collapse.
* **Strategy:** Revisit your KPI weights. Often, **‚Äúnet new paying users‚Äù** and **‚Äúnew CAC‚Äù** together account for **50%+** of total weight.
* **Budget Decision:** Redirect **some budget** from high-risk quality plays to **low-CAC, scalable channels** (e.g., TikTok, ASA) to secure stable KPI scores.

**This ‚Äúsacrifice the impossible, protect the achievable‚Äù mindset helps maintain balanced KPI performance and ensures your final results remain defensible‚Äîeven under extreme challenges.**
