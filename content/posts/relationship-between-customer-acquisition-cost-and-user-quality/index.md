In today’s digital marketing environment, growth teams face a common challenge: **the imbalance between acquisition scale and acquisition efficiency**.

In the past, many teams treated lowering Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) as a core KPI. When traffic supply was relatively abundant, this price-driven strategy did enable rapid user growth. However, as market competition intensified, the drawbacks of pursuing low-cost acquisition alone began to surface.

In practice, a reduction in front-end acquisition costs does not always translate into improved back-end returns. A common scenario is that users acquired through low-cost channels or aggressive promotions may lower the average CAC, but significantly underperform in key metrics such as retention and engagement. Without effective control over user quality, low-cost traffic often results in nothing more than meaningless installs, contributing little real value to the business.

To address this issue, we must revisit how CAC is defined. Evaluating whether a channel or campaign is successful should not be based solely on the absolute value of CAC, but on whether the users acquired at that cost can generate sufficient lifetime value within the expected payback period.


## Why Does Customer Acquisition Cost Keep Rising?

Before analyzing the relationship between CAC and user quality, it is essential to understand the underlying drivers of rising costs. In most cases, increasing CAC is driven by two fundamental forces.

### 1. Competition and Scarcity: The Immediate Response of Market Supply and Demand

This type of cost increase often exists from the early stages of a business and is fundamentally determined by market supply and demand.

* **Scarcity of high-quality traffic:** In any industry, users with high intent and high lifetime value are inherently scarce. In mature sectors such as finance and e-commerce, these users are the primary targets of every brand.
* **Bidding competition:** The core mechanism of major advertising platforms (such as Google and Meta) is **real-time bidding**. When large amounts of capital flood into a limited pool of high-quality audiences, acquisition costs rise rapidly.
* **Market entry barrier:** This increase in cost is not necessarily a sign of poor product performance, but rather the “entry fee” required to access high-quality users in a competitive market.

### 2. Diminishing Marginal Returns: An Inevitable Outcome of Scale Expansion

Unlike competitive pressure, diminishing marginal returns usually emerge in the mid-to-late stages of a business, when the product attempts to reach a broader audience.

* **Audience expansion from near to far:** In the early growth stage, products capture the most precise “core audience”—users with clear needs and high conversion efficiency.
* **Rising persuasion costs:** As scale expands and the core audience is gradually exhausted, teams must penetrate the broader mass market. These users may not urgently need the product or may be completely unfamiliar with the brand. Convincing them to convert requires more ad impressions, more diverse creatives, and longer decision paths, directly leading to stepwise increases in CAC.

Although these two forces typically appear at different stages, they share a highly consistent response strategy. Whether competing aggressively in the early stage or extracting value from mass traffic in later stages, the core objective remains the same: **improving conversion efficiency**. If you can use data to precisely identify scarce, high-quality users and reduce persuasion costs through differentiated marketing strategies, you can maintain a superior cost structure even as diminishing returns set in.


## Defining Quality: User Quality Is a “Verb,” Not a “Noun”

A common mistake in discussions of acquisition efficiency is attempting to measure user quality with a single static standard. In reality, to accurately assess ROI, user quality must be dynamically defined and evaluated based on the business lifecycle stage.

### 1. Early Stage / Market Validation

In the early stage, the primary goal is to **validate product–market fit (PMF)**. At this point, the company needs users who can validate the product’s core value.

* **Quality definition:** Users with high stickiness and strong engagement.
* **Evaluation metrics:** Day-1 / Day-7 retention, core feature usage, qualitative user feedback.
* **Cost guidance:** At this stage, due to small sample sizes and the need for rapid feedback, **a higher CAC is acceptable**. As long as users can be retained and validate the business logic, the premium paid is essentially the cost of validation.

### 2. Growth / Scale Expansion Stage

Once the business enters the expansion phase, the objective shifts to rapidly capturing market share while maintaining a healthy profitability model.

* **Quality definition:** Users with high lifetime value (LTV) and short payback periods.
* **Evaluation metrics:** Conversion rate, payback period, median values of key conversion actions (such as first deposit or initial purchase).
* **Cost guidance:** Strict cost thresholds should be established to control the payback period. Users who cannot generate profit within the defined timeframe are considered “low quality.”

### 3. Maturity / Efficiency Optimization Stage

When the business reaches maturity and market penetration approaches saturation, the focus shifts from acquisition to maximizing existing value and improving margins.

* **Quality definition:** High-net-worth users with low maintenance costs and strong cross-product adoption potential.
* **Evaluation metrics:** Net contribution after operating costs, churn rate, cross-product usage rate.
* **Cost guidance:** At this stage, the focus is on **net incremental value**. Companies may be willing to pay very high acquisition costs for the top 10% of high-value users, as their marginal profit is substantial enough to offset upfront investment.


## Three Dimensions to Balance Cost and Quality

Once quality is clearly defined for each stage, the next step is to identify optimal operational strategies amid cost fluctuations. This can be approached from three dimensions.

### 1. Channel Dimension: From “Single-Source Acquisition” to “Portfolio Allocation”

The first step in addressing rising costs is to reduce reliance on a single channel and establish a dynamic traffic allocation model.

* **Macro-level budget orchestration:**
  Create a balanced mix of “high-quality channels” and “cost-efficient channels.” For example, search channels (SEM/ASA) typically have higher CAC but stronger intent and serve as the quality foundation, while feed-based channels (Meta/TikTok) broaden reach and help average down overall costs. Real-time budget adjustments across channels help stabilize overall ROI.
* **Precision optimization within each channel:**
  Different strategies should be applied based on channel characteristics.

  * **Search channels:** Focus on granular keyword bidding to maximize capture of high-intent queries.
  * **Display channels:** Leverage platform algorithms such as **Value-Based Optimization (VBO)**. By feeding back high-quality post-conversion signals (e.g., deposits or high-value purchases), the algorithm can automatically filter out low-value users and allocate budget toward high-potential audiences.

### 2. Lifecycle Dimension: From “Front-End Acquisition” to “Full-Funnel Operations”

CAC should not be borne solely by front-end media buying. Extending user lifetime value is an effective way to offset rising acquisition costs.

* **Front-end retargeting:**
  Many high-quality users do not convert on their first interaction. Retargeting these “lost but high-potential” users typically delivers much higher conversion efficiency than acquiring entirely new users, significantly reducing blended CAC.
* **In-product refined operations:**
  After users enter the product, CRM systems and segmented operations can be used to improve repeat purchases and engagement. As LTV increases, the business can tolerate higher front-end CAC, gaining a stronger competitive position in bidding markets.

### 3. Product Dimension: Optimizing “Friction” at Conversion Touchpoints

Product optimization is not only about improving conversion rates—it is also about filtering users.

* **Optimizing critical conversion paths:**
  Use A/B testing to shorten the path from “registration” to “core action,” reducing unnecessary drop-offs caused by overly complex flows.
* **Using friction to filter quality:**
  This is a counterintuitive but effective strategy. For broad traffic from low-cost channels, it can be beneficial to **intentionally increase barriers (friction)**.

> **Example:** Adding more detailed risk assessments or questionnaires during account opening may raise effective front-end CAC, but it filters out low-value users and ensures that only users with real business value reach downstream teams, ultimately improving overall efficiency.


As AI-driven optimization and automated media buying become increasingly prevalent, future growth competition will no longer be purely about bidding power. Instead, it will be a competition of **data granularity** and **definition capability**. Those who can clearly define what constitutes a “high-quality user” and accurately feed these signals back into their systems will gain control amid cost volatility and achieve sustainable, efficiency-driven growth.
