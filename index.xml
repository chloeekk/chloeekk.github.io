<p>Put simply, the majority of variation in investment returns does not depend on whether you bought Alibaba or Tencent. Instead, it depends on which <strong>asset class</strong> you choose to allocate your money to—high-risk, high-return <strong>stocks</strong>, lower-risk <strong>bonds</strong> that provide stable income, or simply holding cash.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>How to Manage Stock Portfolio?</title><link>https://chloevolution.com/posts/how-to-manage-stock-portfolio/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 07:12:23 +0800</pubDate><author>Chloe</author><guid>https://chloevolution.com/posts/how-to-manage-stock-portfolio/</guid><description><![CDATA[<h2 id="universal-philosophy-of-investing">Universal Philosophy of Investing</h2>
<p>Whether engaging in low-cost index investing or high-intensity active speculation, the success of all market participants rests on a shared philosophical foundation.</p>
<h3 id="the-preparation-process-for-trading">The Preparation Process for Trading</h3>
<p>Investing and speculating are not driven by luck or impulse. They require the knowledge and discipline of a professional.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Acquire Knowledge</strong>: Before committing money, you must commit time, money, and effort to learning how markets function, how to manage risk, and how to analyze assets. Without intellectual investment, sustained returns are impossible.</li>
<li><strong>Professional Attitude</strong>: Treat trading the same way you would treat professional matters (like consulting a doctor or engineer). Never commit large sums to a position or strategy you do not fully understand.</li>
</ul>

This framework consists of the two core branches of biomechanics—<strong>kinematics</strong> and <strong>kinetics</strong>—and their sub-branches.</p>
<p>You can think of understanding human movement like building a house. The following four concepts serve as the <strong>four key pillars</strong> that support this structure:</p>

<p><strong>What is it?</strong>
The P/E ratio, simply put, tells you how many dollars you must pay in price for <strong>every $1 of profit</strong> a company earns.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>What does it measure?</strong>
The P/E ratio reflects the market’s <strong>expectations</strong> and <strong>premium</strong> for a company.
