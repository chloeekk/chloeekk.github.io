    <description><![CDATA[Why Is User Quality Assessment Critical? The core competition in digital marketing has shifted from &ldquo;acquiring traffic&rdquo; to &ldquo;screening high-quality users.&rdquo; With rising traffic costs and increasingly complex user behavior, blindly pursuing user quantity leads to resource waste: Low-quality users may generate short-term clicks but fail to deliver long-term returns (e.g., fake clicks, coupon abuse).
