      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been suffering from the index of website pages. I have published new articles, but the number of pages not indexed has increased. So I used SEMrush to audit the website as a whole and made some corrections for specific problems to see if the index situation will improve.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Site audit function is used. After entering the domain name and setting the number of pages to crawl, wait for about ten minutes and you can get an analysis report:&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;https://chloevolution.com/posts/seo-audit-my-site/semrush-site-audit-report_hu_a6f16604bd1c270a.png&#34; &#xA;       alt=&#34;&#34; &#xA;       width=&#34;1555&#34; &#xA;       height=&#34;314&#34; &#xA;        /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In SEO optimization, the visibility and click-through rate of a website depend on multiple factors, and the optimization of &lt;strong&gt;domain name&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;landing page name&lt;/strong&gt; is a crucial part. Although both are important components of website SEO, their optimization focuses are different. Understanding the difference between the two will help you develop a more accurate SEO strategy for your website, thereby improving rankings and user conversion rates. On this basis, this article provides recommendations for two types of tools: &amp;ldquo;domain name generation tool&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;page title optimization tool&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-keyword-research-and-targeting&#34;&gt;What is keyword research and targeting&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-meaning-of-keyword-research&#34;&gt;The meaning of keyword research&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Keyword research refers to finding common words or phrases used by users in search engines through systematic analysis and data mining. This process helps websites or brands understand the search habits of potential audiences and identify high-potential keywords related to their business or products.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Keywords are not just single words, they can be phrases, sentences, or even questions. For example, users may search for &amp;ldquo;best coffee machine recommendation&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;how to choose a coffee machine.&amp;rdquo; By studying these search phrases, we can understand user needs and create content that matches them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
