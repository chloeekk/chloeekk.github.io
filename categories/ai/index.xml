But when you ask it for your company’s latest sales data, or to book a meeting room, it suddenly seems to “forget” everything and cannot respond. Why does this happen?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The reason is that most AI models do not directly access your proprietary information; they mostly rely on general knowledge learned from training data. To enable AI to truly “get things done,” it requires two key components: &lt;strong>Agents&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>Knowledge Bases&lt;/strong>. The agent serves as AI’s “action brain,” capable of understanding instructions, invoking tools, and executing tasks; the knowledge base acts as AI’s “memory repository,” storing enterprise data, documents, and rules so the AI can access and utilize up-to-date information.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>AI Beginner's Guide: General-Purpose Model vs Inference Model</title><link>https://chloevolution.com/posts/inference-model-vs-general-purpose-model/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Aug 2025 17:09:01 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://chloevolution.com/posts/inference-model-vs-general-purpose-model/</guid><description>&lt;p>We actually interact with AI every day.
Opening ChatGPT to draft a copy? That’s AI.
Using your phone to take a photo of a dish and get calorie information? That’s also AI.
Translation apps, speech-to-text, automatic recognition in your photo library—all rely on AI.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They may look similar, but the underlying mechanisms are completely different.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>General-Purpose Model&lt;/strong>: Can handle a wide range of tasks. ChatGPT is an example. In academia, you might also hear the term &lt;strong>Foundation Model&lt;/strong>, while in practical use, people often refer to &lt;strong>Large Language Model (LLM)&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Inference Model&lt;/strong>: Specialized for a specific type of task, such as image recognition, translation, or speech recognition. Sometimes called &lt;strong>Deployment Model&lt;/strong> or &lt;strong>Task-Specific Model&lt;/strong>, emphasizing optimization for specific tasks.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Why differentiate? Because it determines how you should use them:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Introduction to Content Engineering: Making Content Smarter and More Usable</title><link>https://chloevolution.com/posts/content-engineering/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Aug 2025 16:06:25 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://chloevolution.com/posts/content-engineering/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="why-should-we-care-about-content">Why Should We Care About Content?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In today’s digital world, we interact with &amp;ldquo;content&amp;rdquo; almost every day. Whether browsing websites, scrolling through short videos, using mobile apps, or chatting with smart assistants, the core of these experiences is various forms of content. In other words, content has become the primary medium through which we communicate, gather information, and make decisions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, despite being ubiquitous, content often faces a common problem: &lt;strong>fragmentation and duplication&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How Can SEO and SEM Collaborate to Adapt to AI Max for Search?</title><link>https://chloevolution.com/posts/ai-max-for-search-seo-sem-collaboration-customer-acquisition/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 07:08:54 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://chloevolution.com/posts/ai-max-for-search-seo-sem-collaboration-customer-acquisition/</guid><description>&lt;p>With generative AI fully penetrating the advertising space, Google&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/google-ai-max-for-search-campaigns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">AI Max for Search&lt;/a> is transforming how search marketing operates. Similar automated ad products have also emerged on platforms like Meta and TikTok.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Compared to the traditional keyword-centric approach, AI Max for Search relies more on comprehensive learning from user behavior signals, historical conversion data, and creative assets, with AI autonomously deciding when, to whom, and in what combination to display ads. Simply put, manual control is giving way to &amp;ldquo;signal feeding&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;model learning.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>FounderPal Review: AI Marketing Tool Hands-On Experience</title><link>https://chloevolution.com/posts/founderpal-review/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 May 2025 11:59:03 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://chloevolution.com/posts/founderpal-review/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://founderpal.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">FounderPal&lt;/a> is an AI-powered marketing platform, somewhat similar to &lt;a href="https://chloevolution.com/posts/swiftbrief-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Swiftbrief&lt;/a>, which we previously reviewed.

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Low Detail Processing&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Reduce textures and decorative details on model surfaces, retaining only essential contour features to emphasize clean overall forms.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Soft Color Schemes&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Predominantly use low-saturation tones (e.g., Morandi color palette) with gentle light-dark contrasts, avoiding high contrast or fluorescent colors.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Midjourney Advanced Tutorial</title><link>https://chloevolution.com/posts/midjourney-advanced-tutorial/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 07:54:32 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://chloevolution.com/posts/midjourney-advanced-tutorial/</guid><description>&lt;p>In &lt;a href="https://chloevolution.com/posts/midjourney-tutorial-for-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">《Midjourney Tutorial for Beginners》&lt;/a>, we covered Midjourney&amp;rsquo;s basic setup, commands, parameters, and image generation methods.

It is mainly used to extract character features from reference images and apply them to new images to achieve coherence and consistency in character design. It allows users to specify one or more images as content references. Midjourney will use these reference images to help generate images with similar content. This feature is more suitable for anime or games.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A workflow is a set of predefined, standardized steps that can be used to complete a specific task. A workflow contains multiple nodes, each of which completes a fixed task.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To give an example that is not very appropriate but easy to understand, we are all familiar with the brain teaser &amp;ldquo;How many steps does it take to put an elephant in the refrigerator?&amp;rdquo; The answer is three steps: open the refrigerator, put the elephant in, and close the refrigerator. In this scenario, these three steps constitute the nodes of the workflow &amp;ldquo;Put the elephant in the refrigerator&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to Use Midjourney SREF to Control Style Consistency</title><link>https://chloevolution.com/posts/midjourney-sref/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2024 11:02:02 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://chloevolution.com/posts/midjourney-sref/</guid><description>&lt;hr>
&lt;p>The full name of the &amp;mdash;sref command is &amp;ldquo;Style References,&amp;rdquo; which aims to help users replicate and maintain consistency in the style of images.Its main function is to allow users to upload one or more images as style references to guide Midjourney in generating images that are consistent in style with these reference images.This instruction is particularly useful when you come across an image you really like and want to try generating similar or identical styles, but you don&amp;rsquo;t know what that style is.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Step by step guide - How to Create Bot on Coze</title><link>https://chloevolution.com/posts/how-to-create-bot-on-coze/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2024 08:03:46 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://chloevolution.com/posts/how-to-create-bot-on-coze/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="what-is-coze">What is Coze?&lt;/h2>
