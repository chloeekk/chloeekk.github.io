&lt;p>&lt;strong>Performance Max (PMax)&lt;/strong> is a fully automated campaign type by Google that allows advertisers to run a single campaign across all Google-owned channels—Search, Display, YouTube, Gmail, Discover, Maps, and more. It serves as a &lt;strong>complement to Search Ads&lt;/strong>, helping advertisers reach more potential customers across multiple touchpoints.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Demand Gen Campaigns&lt;/strong>, on the other hand, are designed for visually engaging platforms like YouTube and Google Discover. They focus on &lt;strong>sparking interest and creating demand&lt;/strong> through short-form videos and in-feed content—ideal for attracting new audiences to your brand or products.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Do Tariffs Affect PPC Advertising?</title><link>https://chloevolution.com/posts/how-will-the-tariffs-impact-ppc-campaigns/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 09:39:55 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://chloevolution.com/posts/how-will-the-tariffs-impact-ppc-campaigns/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>The answer is definitely: Yes.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When new tariffs are imposed or existing ones are expanded, the &lt;strong>fundamental cost structure of goods&lt;/strong> changes, and companies&amp;rsquo; bidding behaviors also shift:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Some companies will increase their bids to secure the best ad positions, hoping to maintain existing profits.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some companies will maintain their current bid levels in the short term, but ad spend may still rise (influenced by other advertisers increasing their bids, leading to an overall industry CPC increase). In the short term, they&amp;rsquo;ll choose to absorb costs to maintain market share.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Other companies will choose to exit this new round of competition, shifting their marketing budgets to other channels.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="what-are-tariffs">What are Tariffs?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A tariff (Customs Duty) is a mandatory tax levied by a sovereign nation or economic entity on &lt;strong>imported goods&lt;/strong> as they cross its customs border. It&amp;rsquo;s one of the most common forms of trade barriers in international trade, enforced and collected by customs agencies.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Comprehensive Guide to Digital Advertising Types</title><link>https://chloevolution.com/posts/types-of-digital-advertising/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 May 2025 07:49:06 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://chloevolution.com/posts/types-of-digital-advertising/</guid><description>&lt;p>Digital advertising reaches target audiences through diverse formats.

&lt;h2 id="background">Background&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>After graduation, I entered an Internet company responsible for overseas promotion, and after a year, I switched to be an overseas advertising specialist, and since then, I have started my road of Google advertising. I have pushed new products, been in charge of high net worth products, experienced the whole account being blocked, and recently started to learn to recruit competent subordinates. Although the market situation is not optimistic in these years, from my personal experience, from the perspective of salary and market demand, overseas advertising specialist is still a good career choice. I hope this article can provide some reference for those who are interested in the position of Google Ads specialist.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
