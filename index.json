A workflow contains multiple nodes, each of which completes a fixed task. To give an example that is not very appropriate but easy to understand, we are all familiar with the brain teaser “How many steps does it take to put an elephant in the refrigerator?” The answer is three steps: open the refrigerator, put the elephant in, and close the refrigerator. In this scenario, these three steps constitute the nodes of the workflow “Put the elephant in the refrigerator”.

I believe you have had similar feelings when using ChatGPT or Claude directly. In the short term, it is difficult for us to require large language models to achieve significant improvements in context processing capabilities. Then another solution is to decompose the complex tasks input to the Bot into multiple simple subtasks to ensure the quality of the Bot output content.

It can query and summarize relevant information in Google based on the target keywords entered by the user, and comes with corresponding content links. First, we need to create a Bot (if you are not sure how to create one, you can read a previous article), then click the “+” sign after “Workflow”: Enter the name and description of the workflow. Note that the name can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores, and must start with a letter. Then click “Confirm”: After that, enter the workflow editing page, and you can see that Coze will automatically generate the Start node and End node. On the left is the optional basic node mentioned above: First, we need to determine how to get the information we want from Google. In the past, we used to access the API directly by writing code to collect the information we need. In Coze, you can directly use plug-ins to complete this task. Click the “Plugin” button on the left, then select the Google Web Search plug-in and add it: The trigger of this workflow is the keyword entered by the user, so we need to configure a string type parameter in the Start node to receive the input text, named query here: The keyword information needs to flow to the Google Web Search plug-in, which completes the text processing and retrieval tasks. The operations here include: Set it to query in the previous step Connect the right side of the start node and the left side of the plug-in node to indicate the order between tasks In addition, we can also set two other parameters: num parameter: defines the maximum number of search results returned, the default is 10 start parameter: sets the number of pages to be searched, the default is 0, that is, the first page of search results At this time, we can first click “Test run” in the upper right corner to test the output effect. Here we input “chatgpt” as an example, and you can see that Coze took 3 seconds to successfully run this workflow. Click “Display result” in the upper right corner of the plug-in node to view the specific results of its processing task: I hope that the final output of this workflow includes: the title, description, and corresponding link of each search result. This information is mixed in the output results of the Google Web Search plug-in, so I need a Code node to extract this information. After placing the Code node between the plug-in node and the End node, set the input parameter to the output result of the plug-in node, and then click Edit in IDE to enter the code editing page: Currently, the Code node supports two languages ​​​​— Python and JavaScript. If you don’t know how to write code, you can also let the AI ​​write it for you by entering a natural language prompt in the built-in AI. After writing, click “Test Code” to test whether the code can run normally: After confirming that the code runs normally, we can test the operation of the entire workflow again. Although we can extract the corresponding result title, link, and summary from Google search results at this point, all the information is piled together, so we still need an LLM node to help us organize the information.

As the value of k increases, the size of each cluster generally decreases, and therefore the distance of each point to its cluster center decreases, resulting in a decrease in SSE. Find the “elbow point”: Ideally, we want to find a small k value while keeping the SSE relatively small. When we plot the SSE corresponding to different k values, as the k value increases, the decline rate of SSE will slow down, and the curve will show an “elbow” shape. This “elbow point” is often considered the optimal number of clusters, as adding more clusters after this point does not significantly improve model fit (i.e., decrease in SSE) Taking into account the impact of random initialization: The KMeans algorithm randomly selects k clustering centers at the beginning, which may cause the algorithm results to be affected by the initial selection, making the final clustering result somewhat random. In order to obtain consistent results across multiple runs or different environments, we can set a random state. Here, by setting random_state=123, we ensure that the initial random selection of cluster centers is the same every time we run KMeans, making the results reproducible.

Increase in cluster centers: When we increase the number of clusters k, it means that more cluster centers can be used to represent data points. As the number of cluster centers increases, each data point is more likely to be assigned to a cluster center that is closer to it, so the average distance of each point to its cluster center will decrease, resulting in lower SSE. Decrease in cluster size: As the k value increases, the number of data points contained in each cluster usually decreases. Smaller clusters make data points within the cluster closer, reducing the distance between data points and their cluster centers, further reducing SSE. Extreme cases: In extreme cases, if the value of k is equal to the total number of data points, then each data point is its own cluster center, and the SSE will be 0. But this situation has no actual clustering significance and just illustrates why SSE will continue to decrease as k increases. #Use the KMeans clustering algorithm and specify the maximum number of clusters to test as 10 #KElbowVisualizer will evaluate k values from 1 to 10 to decide which k value is the best choice #Call the fit method to train the KMeans model elbow = KElbowVisualizer(KMeans(random_state=123), k=10) elbow.fit(df_final_scaled) elbow.show() The result of the run is a graph of different k values (number of clusters) and the corresponding SSE (sum of squared errors). The purpose of the elbow plot is to help us visually see how the SSE changes as the value of k increases. Ideally, SSE decreases as the k value increases, but the rate of decrease will slow down significantly at a certain point. This point is the so-called “elbow point” and is considered the optimal number of clusters.

Here are a few key points on how to interpret kernel density estimation plots: Peaks: The peaks on the KDE chart represent the mode area in the data, that is, there are more data points near this value. There can be multiple peaks on a plot, indicating that the data distribution may be multimodal (i.e., there are multiple modes). Width: The width of the graph reflects the variability or dispersion of the data. A kernel density plot with a larger width indicates that the data points are more dispersed; conversely, a plot with a narrower width indicates that the data points are more concentrated. Skewness: If the KDE plot is not completely symmetrical, the data distribution may be skewed. If the graph extends longer to the right, the data is positively skewed (right-skewed), that is, more data values are to the left of the mean; if the graph extends longer to the left, the data is negatively skewed (left-skewed), That is, more data values are to the right of the mean. Tails: The tail of the KDE plot can tell us the tail behavior of the data distribution, such as whether there is a long tail or extreme values. A long tail is when one end of the graph extends very far, indicating that there are some extreme high or low values. Overlay Plot: Sometimes, researchers will draw multiple KDE plots on the same graph to compare the data distribution of different subsets. At this time, you can understand the distribution differences between different subsets by observing which areas overlap more and the shape differences of each graph. Kernel density estimation and actual data: It should be noted that the kernel density estimation graph represents an estimate of the data distribution, not the actual data distribution. Therefore, it is useful for revealing overall trends in the data, but may not be suitable for precise statistical testing. Plot the kernel density estimates of “parent or not” and “total spent”: g = sns.FacetGrid(data=df, col='Cluster') g.map(sns.kdeplot, 'Is_Parent', 'Total_Spent', color='#95C8D8', fill=True) plt.text(0.6,3900, '0: Non Parent\\n1: Parent', weight='bold', fontsize=12) Plot the kernel density estimates of “number of children” and “total spent”: g = sns.FacetGrid(data=df, col='Cluster') g.map(sns.kdeplot, 'Kidhome', 'Total_Spent', color='#95C8D8', fill=True) Plot the kernel density estimates of “number of teenagers” and “total spent”: g = sns.FacetGrid(data=df, col='Cluster') g.map(sns.kdeplot, 'Teenhome', 'Total_Spent', color='#95C8D8', fill=True) Plot the kernel density estimates of “total children” and “total spent”: g = sns.FacetGrid(data=df, col='Cluster') g.map(sns.kdeplot, 'Total_Children', 'Total_Spent', color='#95C8D8', fill=True) Plot the kernel density estimates of “relationship status” and “total spent”: g = sns.FacetGrid(data=df, col='Cluster') g.map(sns.kdeplot, 'Living_With', 'Total_Spent', color='#95C8D8', fill=True) plt.text(0.7,3900, '0: Alone\\n1: Partner', weight='bold', fontsize=12) Draw a scatter plot of “education status” and “total spent”: g = sns.FacetGrid(data=df, col='Cluster') g.map(sns.scatterplot, 'Education', 'Total_Spent', color='#95C8D8') plt.text(0.6,3400, '0: Graduate\\n1: Postgraduate\\n2: Undergraduate', weight='bold', fontsize=12) ","date":"2024-04-07","objectID":"/posts/customer-profiling-and-segmentation/:6:2","tags":["Python"],"title":"Customer Profiling \u0026 Segmentation with Python (Source code)","uri":"/posts/customer-profiling-and-segmentation/"},{"categories":["Python"],"content":"How to analyze a scatter plot? Correlation Positive correlation: If an increase in one variable is accompanied by an increase in the other variable, then there is a positive correlation between the two variables. In a scatter plot, this appears as a general trend of the set of points from lower left to upper right. Negative correlation: If an increase in one variable is accompanied by a decrease in the other variable, then there is a negative correlation between the two variables. In a scatter plot, this appears as a general trend of the set of points from upper left to lower right. No correlation: If there is no obvious linear relationship between the two variables, the point set is relatively evenly distributed on the graph and there is no obvious trend. Clusters The points on a scatter plot sometimes form one or more clusters, indicating the presence of distinct subgroups in the data. These clusters may represent different categories, groups, or data points with similar characteristics. Outliers In a scatter plot, points that are far away from other data points are called outliers. These points may represent data entry errors, measurement errors, or actual data distribution properties. Trend Line Sometimes a trend line (such as a linear regression line) is added to a scatter plot to more clearly show the main trend between variables. The slope and direction of a trend line provide a visual representation of the relationship between variables. Distribution density In some scatter plots, the density of points reflects the concentration of data in that area. Areas with denser points indicate that there are more data points there.

These actions could include activities such as purchases made in a physical store, phone calls to a business, or in-person transactions. The process generally begins with a unique identifier, like a Google Click ID (GCLID) or a Facebook Pixel, being assigned to each visitor who clicks on an online ad. This identifier is then saved along with any lead information collected from the individual. Later, when the customer performs an action offline - for example, making a purchase in a brick-and-mortar store - this offline activity is matched with the saved online click ID. If a match is found, the offline conversion can be attributed to the specific online ad campaign that initially led the customer to the business. Offline conversion tracking provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of online marketing campaigns. It helps businesses understand how their online ads are driving real-world outcomes, enabling them to optimize their strategies for better targeting and increased conversion rates.

Attribution of Offline Conversions to Online Activities Connecting offline conversions to specific online activities can be difficult. For instance, if a customer clicks on an online ad but makes a purchase in a physical store, attributing this sale to the online ad is challenging. Tracking solutions like Google Click ID (GCLID) can help, but they require advanced setup and continuous management. Privacy and Compliance Issues With growing concerns about data privacy and increasingly stringent regulations, businesses need to ensure that their offline conversion tracking methods are compliant with laws such as GDPR and CCPA. This adds another layer of complexity to the process. Time Lag in Reporting Unlike online conversions that can be tracked in real-time, offline conversions often involve a time lag. This delay can make it harder to react quickly to trends and optimize campaigns effectively.

I have pushed new products, been in charge of high net worth products, experienced the whole account being blocked, and recently started to learn to recruit competent subordinates. Although the market situation is not optimistic in these years, from my personal experience, from the perspective of salary and market demand, overseas advertising specialist is still a good career choice. I hope this article can provide some reference for those who are interested in the position of Google Ads specialist.

In most cases, yes. Generally companies with overseas advertising specialist positions have the need to go overseas, so foreign language skills are a certain ability that will be assessed. Usually the requirement is at least IELTS 7 level (if you have relevant experience, you may be able to relax the requirement), some of the more demanding companies will ask you the specific grade 6 score, if it is just over the passing line, it may also be seen as a minus. For students majoring in minor languages, minor languages will be a plus for you, but you must also pass the English level. Will Google Ad Specialist be very busy? Do you need to work overtime a lot? If anyone has probably understood the position of overseas advertising specialist, they may have seen a lot of practitioners are discouraged to quit, citing “very serious overtime”, “no personal time”, “need to keep an eye on the account on holidays \" and so on. It must be admitted that overtime is a relatively common situation for this position, but it cannot be generalized. According to my own situation and the situation of related practitioners around me, whether overtime and the intensity of overtime will be affected by the following two factors: Party A \u0026 B Company There is also a distinction between A and B party companies for overseas advertising. Party A refers to companies that have self-developed products (games, software, physical products, etc.), and then hire specialized personnel to be responsible for overseas advertising of these products. A B-side company is a company that provides advertising management or consulting services for the A-side company, usually called an agency (advertising agency) in the industry. In the vast majority of cases, the overtime of Party B staff will be much more serious. Because Party A staff is responsible for the entire company’s product advertising accounts, while Party B staff usually have at least five clients' advertising accounts on hand, each client needs to promote a different number of products. I learned that one of the scarier figures is that there is an optimizer in Baidu who had more than 100 accounts in his hands. So, obviously, don’t go to a B-side company if you can find an A-side job. When screening jobs and companies, it is actually easy to see whether the job belongs to the A-side or B-side. In the job postings appear similar to the words “advertiser”, “advertisers”, is basically the position of the second party company. Promoted product types The more common types of products are: games, software, physical products (such as clothing, shoes and socks, accessories, etc.). For software and physical products, there will also be a distinction between C- and B-sides. Generally speaking, the overtime intensity is as follows (look at toB or toC first, then product type) C-side \u003e B-side Game \u003e physical product (partial e-commerce) \u003e software (non-game type) The size and magnitude of change of advertising traffic and the degree of market competition determine the frequency and intensity of your overtime. In addition, by the way, the overtime intensity of Google ad specialists is usually not as strong as that of Facebook ad specialists, because the algorithm mechanism of the two platforms is different, the latter has higher requirements for data continuity, and due to the existence of time differences, it usually requires the specialists to get up in the middle of the night to see if the account is abnormal. Is the Google Ad Specialist only responsible for Google channels? Can the experience be applied to other platforms? Google Ads specialists are usually only responsible for Google channels, but some smaller companies may have one specialist responsible for multiple channels (e.g. Facebook, Tiktok, Instagram, etc.). Regarding whether the experience can be reused, it needs to be judged according to different platform placement and algorithm mec","date":"2023-01-26","objectID":"/posts/what-does-a-google-ads-specialist-do/:2:0","tags":["SEM","Google Ads"],"title":"What does a Google Ads Specialist do?","uri":"/posts/what-does-a-google-ads-specialist-do/"},{"categories":["SEM"],"content":"Job Description The daily work of Google Ads Specialist includes the following.
