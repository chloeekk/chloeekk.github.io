This explains why deleting an image from a note doesn’t remove the image file from the folder—the note only references it, while the image file itself remains independent.

First, let’s understand the concept of bidirectional links in Obsidian: Bidirectional links (Backlinks) are one of Obsidian’s most core and valuable features. Their significance lies in: Not only can you “reference” other notes, but Obsidian also automatically shows you “which notes mention the current one.” This “mutual awareness” is what sets Obsidian apart from traditional note-taking tools: You don’t manually organize structure—notes “build networks” on their own. For example, suppose you have two notes: Note A: What is Markdown? Note B: Obsidian Features Overview In Note B, you write: Obsidian supports [[What is Markdown?]] format. What did you do? You linked Note A in Note B. Obsidian automatically displays a “backlink” in Note A: “This note is referenced by Obsidian Features Overview.” Compare “forward links” and “backlinks”: Type Concept Example Forward Link Manually linking another note with [[ ]] In B, type [[A]] Backlink Obsidian shows you which notes mention this one In A, see: “Referenced by B” In other words: Forward links are you saying, “I reference who” Backlinks are the system telling you, “Who references me” Why Are Bidirectional Links Important? Traditional notes are tree-structured (category → subcategory → file), which easily becomes messy. Obsidian’s bidirectional links let you build a networked knowledge structure, where notes freely connect and cross-reference. This helps you: String ideas together Rediscover forgotten content Build your “second brain” How to View Backlinks in Obsidian? When you open a note: In the bottom-right or right sidebar, there’s a “Backlinks” panel It shows “which notes mention this one” You can click these notes to quickly jump to their context In summary: Bidirectional links = Automatically building a knowledge network, no longer taking isolated notes, but letting information interconnect to form a system. How to Create Bidirectional Links Let’s try a simple demo: Create Another New Note Follow the earlier steps to create a note named Study Plan Add the Following Content: I’ll start planning based on the content of [[My First Note]]. Now, you’ll see “My First Note” highlighted and clickable. In the right panel, you’ll see a line connecting “Study Plan” and “My First Note”: In the link view, you can also see “Study Plan” linking to “My First Note”: “My First Note” has a backlink from “Study Plan”: Click [[My First Note]] You’ll jump to that note. Now you’ve built a bidirectional link structure, where notes can jump between each other like web pages and automatically track references. The first time you open Obsidian, it might feel empty, but once you get used to linking notes, it becomes increasingly engaging. Next, I’ll cover more practical uses, like plugin recommendations, search tips, and daily writing organization. If you’re also using Obsidian, let’s explore it together.

Advertisers no longer dictate every detail of keywords, creatives, or landing pages but instead provide assets, signals, and objectives, leaving the rest to AI.

But one exception remains critical and controllable: content. Whether for SEO or SEM, the core question is the same: “When users search for this term, what valuable content can you provide?” AI decides what to serve, to whom, and where to land based on its holistic understanding of your website content, ad creatives, and user behavior. Thus, content quality, structure, and consistency become the core levers for true collaboration between SEO and SEM. Why is unifying content structure so important? Helps AI correctly understand website content intent Unified expressions in titles, paragraphs, and module layouts help AI assess the relevance between page topics and user search intent. Avoids semantic disconnects where SEO pages emphasize informational completeness while SEM landing pages overly compress content. Optimizes the system’s evaluation and recommendation of page value AI uses structural cues (e.g., H-tags, lists, FAQs) to assess page richness and relevance. Unified structures create clearer signal loops between organic and paid paths. Improves content asset reuse and maintenance efficiency Identical information architectures enable quick adaptation across multiple channels. Large-scale content production and iteration become more manageable and efficient. Suppose you’re a company offering enterprise CRM systems. Your SEO team conducts thorough keyword research and builds well-structured, comprehensive pages around search intents like “customer relationship management software” and “sales automation tools,” with modules including product features, use cases, customer testimonials, FAQs, and CTAs. Meanwhile, the SEM team runs AI Max for Search ads with independently crafted landing pages. These pages are more “sales-driven”—shorter in structure, more exaggerated in language, stripping out explanatory content and leaving only slogans and sign-up buttons. In the era of manual ad placement, A/B testing could work, but under AI Max, problems arise: AI cannot accurately grasp your core value proposition When matching searches for “CRM system automation,” the system sees SEO pages highlighting “customer data management and sales process integration,” while ad landing pages only say “double your sales.” This semantic inconsistency makes it hard for AI to judge intent alignment, reducing placement precision. The system prefers pages with complete structures and stable signals SEO pages, with FAQs, internal links, and higher dwell times, provide clearer signals for AI to evaluate. Ad pages, with simpler structures and sparse behavioral data, lose priority in URL expansion or placements. Dual maintenance burdens content teams, lowering optimization efficiency Maintaining two inconsistent sets of pages wastes resources and prevents AI models from learning unified user behavior logic from historical data, ultimately hurting conversion performance. This example shows that in AI Max for Search’s logic, you can no longer guide ad placements through artificial divisions or channel segregation. The system speaks only one language: structured, intent-aligned, and signal-stable content. Unifying content structure is the prerequisite for AI to “understand who you are.” ","date":"2025-06-26","objectID":"/posts/ai-max-for-search-seo-sem-collaboration-customer-acquisition/:2:0","tags":["SEM","SEO","AI","Digital Marketing"],"title":"How Can SEO and SEM Collaborate to Adapt to AI Max for Search?","uri":"/posts/ai-max-for-search-seo-sem-collaboration-customer-acquisition/"},{"categories":["SEM","SEO","AI","Digital Marketing"],"content":"How to Unify SEO and SEM Structures?

Landing pages still excel in design freedom and conversion efficiency, especially for promotions, launches, and high-tempo campaigns. But AI no longer just “executes settings”—it picks intent-matching, data-rich pages from your entire site. Disjointed content is noise. Future ad landing pages must structurally resemble your website, conversion-focused, yet technically recognizable as part of your trusted content network. Implementation tips: Adopt unified page templates (e.g., product highlights → user value → case studies → FAQs → CTA) across website and ads. Integrate top-performing landing pages into main navigation or sitemaps for structural cohesion. Establish cross-team (SEO/SEM) content workflows: produce once, deploy everywhere, boosting efficiency and AI recognition.

Inventory Current Conversion Rates by Market Check conversion rates by market. If conversion rates are declining in a specific country/region while remaining stable elsewhere, and the profit in that market no longer supports the marketing budget, then consider reducing or even pausing ad spend and reallocating the budget. Re-evaluate Pricing and Value Proposition Carefully calculate new product costs and determine the cost pass-through ratio (fully transferred, partially transferred, temporarily absorbed). Reallocate Ad Budget Based on 1 and 2 Scale back inefficient markets: For countries/regions with high tariff rates and significant sales declines (e.g., the US imposing a 25% tariff on specific categories), reduce the budget by 20%-50%. Explore alternative markets: Increase budgets in lower-tariff regions (e.g., Southeast Asia, the Middle East). Example: Shift 30% of the original US budget to Saudi Arabia or Mexico. Focus on high-profit products: Pause ads for products heavily impacted by tariffs and prioritize categories with profit margins \u003e40% (e.g., accessories, domestically produced goods). Adjust Smart Bidding Settings If you’re using target Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) or Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) bidding, you’ll need to set new target prices based on the new cost structure. Optimize Audience Targeting Exclude audiences with potentially low conversion efficiency. Available conditions include but are not limited to: geographic location, life events, search intent, YouTube content viewed, etc. Optimize Keywords, Creatives, and Landing Page Content Further emphasize non-price value propositions: durability, warranty, local support, sustainability, eco-friendliness. If product prices are increasing, ensure this change is transparent, helping customers understand why prices are rising. Further enhance credibility with customer reviews, return guarantees, shipping policies, etc. Align with Supply Chain and Inventory Management Communicate closely with the supply chain to anticipate the impact of tariff changes on inventory. Utilize PPC platform inventory linking features (e.g., Google Merchant Center’s inventory feed) to automatically pause ads for out-of-stock products. Plan promotional activities in advance to clear potentially accumulated inventory.

Bing Shopping Ads are product catalog-based advertisements within Microsoft’s advertising platform. They dynamically display product images, prices, and names to directly engage users with commercial intent. Key Differences from Traditional Search Ads: No Keyword Bidding: Ads are automatically matched to user search terms based on product attributes (titles, descriptions, categories). Visual Presentation: Image-centric formats (similar to e-commerce platforms) enhance click-through rates. Common Ad Placements: Product carousels at the top of Bing search results (labeled “Sponsored”). Microsoft partner platforms (e.g., Yahoo Shopping, AOL search results). Operational Mechanism Data Source: Microsoft Merchant Center Advertisers must create a product feed (including titles, descriptions, prices, stock status, image links) in Microsoft Merchant Center. Feeds undergo strict validation (e.g., price consistency with official websites, images ≥800×800 pixels). Ad Trigger Logic Search Term Matching: User queries (e.g., “men’s sneakers”) are linked to product titles/categories. Contextual Expansion: Ads may appear for semantically related terms (e.g., showing sneaker ads for “gym outfit ideas”). Ad Delivery \u0026 Conversion Tracking Users are redirected to advertiser websites upon clicking ads. Microsoft Advertising UET tags track conversions, ROAS (return on ad spend), and other KPIs.

Visual subjects are formed through combination or deformation. Low Detail Processing Reduce textures and decorative details on model surfaces, retaining only essential contour features to emphasize clean overall forms. Soft Color Schemes Predominantly use low-saturation tones (e.g., Morandi color palette) with gentle light-dark contrasts, avoiding high contrast or fluorescent colors. Highly Simplified Elements Retain only core visual information in compositions, eliminating redundant backgrounds or decorative elements. Use negative space to enhance subject focus. Abstract Representation Weaken realistic object forms through proportional adjustments or symbolic designs, such as using simplified cloud outlines instead of detailed depictions. Lightweight Textures Employ matte or translucent material effects, avoiding complex light reflections. Use basic highlights to suggest metallic/glass elements. Flattened Spatial Sense Minimize perspective depth through parallel viewing angles or mild axonometric projection, reducing scene layering.

Return rates by category (e.g., apparel sizing issues). Content Preferences: Product categories (e.g., beauty/electronics). Content formats (video/text/UGC). Discount responsiveness. 2. Traffic Sources (Channel Attributes) Match content to channel characteristics: Paid Ads: Search Ads (Google): Keyword-driven demand → Direct product displays. Social Ads (Meta/TikTok): Visual appeal → Interactive elements (short videos). Retargeting Ads (Criteo): Highlight abandoned actions (e.g., price drops). Organic Traffic: SEO: Long-tail queries (e.g., “best budget laptop”) → Comparison guides. Social Organic: KOL/content hashtags → Source-aligned pages.

Hugo prioritizes templates in the root layouts/ directory. If baseof.html doesn’t exist there, copy it from the theme directory first. Does Disabling Text Selection Affect SEO? No direct impact. Search engine crawlers (e.g., Google Bot) primarily parse HTML source code rather than being restricted by CSS styles. The user-select: none property only prevents mouse-based text selection by users. Text remains visible in the HTML source, fully accessible to crawlers. Search engines ignore most CSS styles (except techniques like display: none or visibility: hidden), so user-select: none won’t affect crawling or indexing.

Support fast iteration: because it is a customized page, it has high flexibility in adjusting content and design, and will not affect other businesses. Easy data analysis: the overall CTA logic of the page is basically consistent, the number of user paths is small, and only a small number of channels use this page, which is convenient for subsequent analysis of data effects. Disadvantages: Requires additional design and development costs.

Keep the top navigation bar: Users can understand the general structure of the website through the navigation bar and freely jump to the page they are interested in. Advantages: Cost savings: No additional design and development involved. Strengthen brand consistency: Ensure the overall experience of users on the official website, and at the same time have user comments, third-party evaluation certificates and other pages as support for brand credibility. Disadvantages: Relatively low conversion rate: The official website content is more brand-oriented, and the information is not focused enough. Users are easily distracted by other content such as navigation bars and internal links. Difficult to iterate quickly and data is mixed: Different channels will use official website pages, and content and design adjustments require the consent of multiple parties before they can be promoted. The multiple behavioral paths of users on the website also increase the difficulty of data analysis. As for which form or website structure is better, it still depends on the brand’s own focus and marketing strategy. Take the landing page of monday.com as an example: it is not difficult to find that monday.com uses the official website homepage (https://monday.com/) to accept users who search for its brand words, and uses dedicated landing pages (such as https://monday.com/ap/project-management) to meet users who search for other keywords (here I use project management).

Ambiguous Geographic Intent: Handling vague descriptions (e.g., “coffee shops nearby”) by combining real-time user location (via IP address or device GPS) or search history to infer the specific range. Multilingual/Multi-Region Adaptation: For example, when a user searches for “München,” it may cater to German-speaking users or those in Germany, automatically associating it with “Munich.” Geolocation and Personalized Ranking IP Address and Device Location: Prioritizing local results for the user’s region (e.g., searching “weather” directly displays forecasts for the current location). Regionalized Ranking Strategies: The same query yields different results in different regions (e.g., “food delivery platform” shows DoorDash in New York and Demae-can in Tokyo). Multi-Location Intent: Users may explicitly specify non-local regions (e.g., a Beijing user searching for “Shanghai travel guide”), requiring intent differentiation.

Country-code top-level domains (e.g., .de, .jp) or subdirectories (e.g., example.com/de/). Geographic Relevance Evaluation and Indexing Regionalized Indexing: Pages are categorized and stored by geographic relevance (e.g., “Japan travel” pages are filed under the Asia index partition). Local SEO Weighting: Google My Business profile completeness, local backlinks (e.g., citations from regional media). Density of local keywords on the page (e.g., repeated mentions of “San Francisco Bay Area remodeling company”). Multi-Region Targeting: Use hreflang tags to differentiate language/region versions.

The core competition in digital marketing has shifted from “acquiring traffic” to “screening high-quality users.” With rising traffic costs and increasingly complex user behavior, blindly pursuing user quantity leads to resource waste: Low-quality users may generate short-term clicks but fail to deliver long-term returns (e.g., fake clicks, coupon abuse). By evaluating user quality, businesses can precisely identify high-value segments, allocate budgets to conversion-ready users, and avoid ineffective spending. The essence of user quality assessment lies in identifying real value through cohort analysis. Traditional traffic metrics often obscure user heterogeneity - users acquired during the same period may generate vastly different value due to channel sources, motivations, and behavioral patterns.

The ads promoted “first-order discounts + free shipping,” aiming to boost registration conversions and initial purchases. The campaign targeted new users through Facebook, Google, and Instagram. Based on daily operational reports and monthly summaries, the campaign appeared highly successful: Channel New Registrations First-Order Conversion Rate Average Order Value (USD) CAC (USD) Facebook Ads 12,000 5.2% $46.8 $21.4 Google Ads 8,500 4.8% $49.3 $18.7 Instagram 4,200 6.0% $42.1 $19.8 Compared to the previous quarter’s averages: Average first-order conversion rate increased from 4.1% to 5.2% CAC remained below the annual cap ($25) Monthly new registrations grew by nearly 1.7x From conventional metrics, this campaign achieved a “high-traffic + low-cost” win-win and was preliminarily deemed a “replicable strategy.” However, during the routine review, the data team raised a critical question: Is this growth truly sustainable, or is it just a short-term spike driven by discounts? The key issue isn’t whether “the data is correct” but rather which analytical perspective we use to interpret it.

In digital marketing analytics, we often encounter two distinct approaches: Non-Cohort Analysis and Cohort Analysis.

It provides a “snapshot” of overall metrics like conversion rate, CAC, and GMV for that period. Key Features Time-Sliced: Data is tied to when actions occurred (e.g., “June 1, 2024, cross-channel conversion rate”). Horizontal Comparison: Instant status snapshot (e.g., click costs by channel for the day). Quick Response: Supports hourly adjustments (e.g., detecting abnormal CPM spikes by 3 PM). In our opening case, “new registrations,” “first-order conversion rate,” and “CAC” are classic Non-Cohort metrics. This approach offers: Simplicity: Quick evaluation of overall marketing performance. Periodic Monitoring: Ideal for routine KPI tracking. Cross-Channel Comparison: Understands broad traffic and conversion trends. But it has clear drawbacks: Ignores registration time differences and behavioral path variations. May mask user quality issues in certain channels or periods. Fails to capture behavioral changes and value contributions over the user lifecycle.

Key Features Time-Anchored: Behaviors are measured from the starting event (e.g., Day 7/Day 30 retention for “January 2024 sign-ups”). Longitudinal Tracking: Observes how the same group evolves (e.g., annual repurchase curves for users registered in different months). Causal Validation: Precisely assesses long-term impacts of actions (e.g., how an August redesign affected retention for users acquired then). For example, grouping users who registered from March 1–7 (Cohort 1) and March 8–14 (Cohort 2), then tracking their first-order conversions, repurchase rates, and return rates over time, constitutes Cohort Analysis. Its advantages include: Precise behavioral insights: Maps user value lifecycle trajectories. Granular channel/activity effects: Identifies long-term contributions by acquisition source. Root-cause discovery: Avoids misleading surface-level data. Returning to our jewelry brand case, let’s examine Facebook data with Cohort Analysis: Registration Week Sign-Ups Week 1 Repurchase Rate Week 2 Repurchase Rate Week 3 Repurchase Rate March 1–7 4,000 5.8% 3.1% 1.2% March 8–14 4,500 6.2% 3.0% 1.0% March 15–21 3,500 5.5% 2.8% 0.8% While Week 1 repurchase rates were decent, they plummeted over time, indicating poor long-term retention. In contrast, Google’s cohort repurchase rates were: Registration Week Sign-Ups Week 1 Repurchase Rate Week 2 Repurchase Rate Week 3 Repurchase Rate March 1–7 3,000 7.2% 5.1% 3.6% March 8–14 3,000 7.0% 5.3% 3.9% March 15–21 2,500 6.8% 5.0% 3.7% Google users maintained higher repurchase rates, showing stronger stickiness. Conclusion: While Facebook excelled in initial conversions, its users’ long-term value lagged behind Google’s.

This information can be simple contact information, questionnaire answers, or complex orders or application content. Through Webform, the website can establish a two-way connection with the visitor, thereby achieving the goal of information collection, conversion or interaction. Common types of Webform and corresponding examples There are many types of Webform. The following are several common types and practical application examples: Registration form Used for users to create an account or subscribe to a service, usually including fields such as name, email address, and password. For example, the registration form of LinkedIn allows users to quickly join the platform and get professional content and connections. Contact form It is used for users to contact the company directly, suitable for support, feedback or consultation needs. For example, Apple’s support page provides a simple contact form to help users quickly submit technical questions or inquire about services. Survey form It is used for market research or collecting user feedback, usually including multiple choice and open-ended questions. SurveyMonkey’s survey form is widely used for user satisfaction surveys and product feedback collection. Payment form It is used to enter payment information when shopping online, usually combined with a payment gateway. For example, the payment form provided by Shopify allows merchants and consumers to complete the entire process of order payment. Event registration form It is used to collect registration for conferences, webinars or training. Forms like Eventbrite allow users to quickly register and attend upcoming events. The role of Webforms Webforms are not only interactive tools on websites, but also an important means to promote business goals. With Webforms, companies can interact with customers more efficiently and increase conversion opportunities. Specific functions include: Data collection and analysis Webforms are an efficient way to collect user information. Whether it is basic user information such as name and email address, or deeper personal needs, preferences and behavior data, they can be quickly collected through forms. For example, Airbnb uses booking forms to collect accommodation needs from potential customers and help them customize personalized recommendations. Drive user conversion Optimally designed Webforms can reduce the barriers for users to fill out forms, thereby increasing submission rates. Simple forms and clear calls to action (such as “Register now” or “Get a quote”) can effectively increase user action intentions and thus increase conversion rates. For example, Dropbox has effectively reduced user churn by simplifying its registration form, requiring only email and password. Enhance user trust and experience A well-designed Webform can enhance the professionalism and user experience of the website and help build user trust. The form needs to be easy to understand, with clear error prompts and avoid complicated steps. For example, Zappos’s form design focuses on user comfort, providing clear field labels and friendly operation prompts, so that users feel that the filling process is smooth and unobstructed. Automated marketing and customer relationship management Webform is usually integrated with automation platforms such as customer relationship management (CRM) systems and email marketing tools, which can instantly transmit user information to the back-end system and trigger subsequent marketing actions. For example, Mailchimp’s subscription form can automatically store subscriber information in its system and send welcome emails and subsequent marketing content in real time.

Whether you are designing a simple registration form or a complex questionnaire, it is important to follow some key design principles. By following these principles, you can not only ensure that users can fill out the form smoothly, but also increase their engagement. Here are some proven webform design best practices: Simplicity The first principle of form design is simplicity. As we all know, the simpler the better. Try to remove unnecessary fields to avoid making the form feel too cumbersome for users. Ideally, webforms should only require users to provide the most basic information - this can save users time and increase conversion rates. Every additional field is a potential abandonment point, especially for mobile users, entering long text is a big challenge. Clarity Every field in the form needs to be clear and easy to understand. Field labels should avoid industry jargon or vague wording as much as possible. It is crucial that users can quickly understand what to fill in. Clear labels can reduce users’ cognitive load and avoid confusion during the filling process. More importantly, forms should help users understand why certain information is required and ensure they know how to fill it out through short and powerful instructions or prompts. Feedback mechanism Instant feedback is the key to improving user experience. Webforms should provide instant error prompts when users are typing. By highlighting the error field and providing concise and clear error messages, users can quickly find problems and correct them. This real-time feedback not only improves the effectiveness of the form, but also reduces user frustration and encourages them to continue filling out the form. Usability With the popularity of mobile devices, Webform design must adapt to various devices, especially on mobile and tablet devices. Forms should have responsive design and automatically adjust according to screen size to ensure that users can get a smooth experience whether they are filling out on desktop, tablet or mobile phone. Buttons should be large and easy to click, and form fields should be easy to enter to avoid user experience problems caused by small screens. Trust Users often have concerns when submitting sensitive information (such as personal information or payment data). Therefore, Webform design should strengthen the establishment of trust. By clearly displaying a privacy policy, encryption technology logo, or security certification, users will feel more comfortable submitting their information. Especially in industries such as finance and e-commerce, security and privacy are key factors in users’ choice of whether to fill out a form.

Based on the best design principles, the design of Webforms should take into account the target audience, the business nature of the website, and specific functional requirements. Differences in Webform design for B-end and C-end websites B-end website (corporate website): B-end websites are usually aimed at corporate customers or professionals, and these users pay more attention to efficiency and functionality when filling out forms. Therefore, when designing B-end Webforms, the form usually contains more data fields, such as company name, position, industry, etc. At the same time, B-end users usually need more information to evaluate whether the product or service meets their needs, so the form should provide clear segmentation to avoid information overload. C-end website (consumer website): C-end websites are aimed at ordinary consumers, and users pay more attention to speed and convenience when filling out forms. In this case, the form design should be simplified as much as possible to reduce the number of steps to fill in. For example, many e-commerce websites use a single “register/login” field (such as email or mobile phone number) to avoid cumbersome steps and ensure that users complete the operation in the shortest time, thereby increasing conversion rates. Differences in Webform design in different industries E-commerce website: The Webform of an e-commerce website usually contains key content such as payment information and delivery address. In order to enhance the user’s purchase intention, special attention should be paid to the simplicity and security of the form when designing. For example, when users fill in payment information, the form should ensure that security signs (such as SSL certificates) and clear privacy policy links are displayed. In addition, e-commerce forms should allow users to quickly enter address information to avoid making users feel cumbersome. Education website: The Webform design of an education website needs to collect users’ personal information, learning interests, etc. In order to ensure that users can fill in the form smoothly, the form should have clear segmentation to avoid requiring too much information to be filled in at one time. Multi-step forms and progress bars are common design methods that help increase users’ motivation to fill in the form and avoid their resistance to long forms. Financial Industry: In the financial industry, the design of Webform must not only consider the accuracy of information collection, but also ensure the security of data. Users need to feel that their personal and financial data is strictly protected when filling out forms. Therefore, the design of Webform in the financial industry must show clear security measures, such as encryption technology signs, and provide clear privacy policies and data usage statements. Design differences caused by different Webform implementations Traditional HTML forms: Traditional HTML forms are usually simpler, and the fields are usually basic text boxes, drop-down boxes, etc. This design is suitable for simple forms that do not require complex interactions. However, the user experience of such forms may be poor, especially in terms of error prompts and data validation, which may require manual coding for processing. Dynamic Webform: With the development of technology, dynamic Webform (such as using AJAX, JavaScript and other technologies) has become a popular choice. Dynamic forms provide more interactivity, such as real-time validation, automatic filling, and field conditional display. This type of Webform can not only improve the user experience, but also increase the conversion rate of the form. Dynamic forms are usually more suitable for complex surveys or registration processes.

They have a simple structure and usually consist of text boxes, drop-down menus, radio buttons, and submit buttons. Such forms are easy to implement and highly compatible, and can be supported by almost all browsers. Advantages High compatibility: HTML forms can work properly on various devices and browsers, suitable for websites that need to maximize access. Low learning cost: Developers only need to master basic HTML and CSS knowledge to implement simple forms. Disadvantages Limited user experience: HTML forms lack interactivity and cannot provide real-time error prompts or dynamically display fields. Difficult to expand functions: To implement more advanced functions, such as field conditional display or data validation, additional JavaScript is required, which increases the complexity of development. Applicable scenarios Static pages: For example, a simple contact form, where users only need to enter their name and email. Resource-constrained projects: When the development team has limited time or a tight budget, HTML forms are a reliable choice. Example Early blogs and small personal websites often used HTML forms to collect visitor information, such as message boards.

When creating a domain name for a new website, we usually consider the following aspects: Brand building: A unique and memorable domain name can help enhance brand image and recognition. For example, a domain name like “amazon.com” is not only short and memorable, but also becomes synonymous with the brand. Long-term visibility: Domain name optimization has a greater long-term impact on the overall SEO of the website. A domain name with relevant keywords may slightly improve search rankings, but this is no longer as important as content and user experience in today’s search algorithms. User trust: Choosing authoritative top-level domains (such as “.com”, “.org”) is usually easier to gain user trust, while long domains or domains with hyphens may appear unprofessional.

Improve content relevance: The page name (usually reflected by the title tag and URL) should be highly consistent with the page content and user search intent. For example, the title of a landing page selling running shoes can be “Lightweight running shoes - designed for runners.” Increase click-through rate (CTR): Optimized page names can make users more likely to click in search results. Attractive titles not only contain keywords, but also convey value or emotion, such as “Quick weight loss tips - try these 5 methods.” Flexible use of keywords: Compared with domain names, page names can use long-tail keywords more freely, thereby more targeted to meet specific user needs. Understanding the difference between domain names and landing page names can help develop more precise SEO strategies. Domain name determines the whole picture: It has a profound impact on the brand positioning and user trust of the entire website, so it is more suitable to highlight the brand rather than stuff keywords. Page name affects single page optimization: It directly affects the ranking and click performance of a specific page, and can be more flexible in keyword combination and optimization. Both need to be optimized together: A SEO-optimized domain name plus a well-designed page name combination can significantly improve the search engine performance of the entire website.

These names not only meet the algorithm requirements of search engines, but also can highly match the user’s search intent, thereby increasing the visibility and conversion rate of the website.

In order for a domain name to meet SEO best practices, it generally needs to meet the following criteria: Include relevant keywords: Using keywords related to your business or target market in your domain name can help improve your site’s search engine rankings. For example, if your business is “digital marketing”, a domain name that includes “digitalmarketing” or “onlinemarketing” will help attract relevant search traffic. Notes: While keywords can provide certain SEO benefits, overusing keywords (such as “best-digital-marketing-services.com”) can make the domain name seem long and difficult to remember, so a careful balance needs to be struck. Simple and memorable: Simple, clear domain names are easier for users to remember and type into a browser. Avoid using long, complex or misspelled words to ensure that the domain name is easy to spread. Positive examples: google.com: A short, easy-to-spell, and globally recognizable domain name that users can easily remember and access directly. apple.com: A simple and branded domain name that is highly recognizable and requires little additional promotion to gain widespread user memory. Bad examples: best-seo-tips-for-your-website.com: Although it contains keywords, this domain name is very long and complex, difficult to remember, and not easy to type. Search engines may also consider this as a sign of over-optimization, which may affect the SEO effect of the website. buycheapsneakersandfootwearonline4u.com: Such a domain name is not only long, but also difficult to remember. If a user wants to visit this website, they need to spend extra time typing this domain name, which is not good for the long-term development of the brand. Avoid hyphens and numbers: Hyphens (such as “-”) and numbers usually make the domain name more complicated, which is not conducive to user memory and dissemination. Search engines also tend to give priority to domain names without hyphens, so it is recommended to avoid such characters as much as possible. Choose the right top-level domain name (TLD): Top-level domain names (such as .com, .org, .net, etc.) are an important factor affecting user trust. Although different TLDs have less impact on SEO, .com is generally considered more reliable and has global recognition.

To ensure that landing page names meet SEO requirements, the following standards need to be followed: Include target keywords: The page title and URL should try to include keywords that users may use when searching. This not only helps the page’s search engine ranking, but also ensures that the page matches the user’s search intent and improves the relevance of the page. For example, if your page is about “SEO Optimization Services”, the title should include “SEO Optimization Services” and the URL can be www.example.com/seo-optimization-services, which will help search engines identify the topic of the page. Attractiveness of title tags and descriptions: The title tag is the first thing that search engines read and is also the text displayed in search results. A clear and attractive title can significantly increase the click-through rate (CTR) of the page. At the same time, the title should not be too long, and it is generally recommended to be controlled within 50-60 characters so that it can be fully displayed in search results. Simple URL structure: Similar to page titles, URLs should be as concise and descriptive as possible. Ideally, URL structures should include target keywords and avoid using long numbers or meaningless parameters. For example, www.example.com/seo-tips is more SEO-friendly than www.example.com/page/1234. Highly consistent with content: Page names need to be highly consistent with the content of the page, and avoid using names that are irrelevant or inaccurate to the content. This not only helps search engines accurately index pages, but also improves user experience and engagement, and reduces bounce rates.

Avoid over-optimization: Although including keywords is a necessary condition for SEO, excessive keyword stacking (such as “best-seo-tips-for-your-website.com”) may be judged as keyword stacking by search engines, thus affecting rankings.

Provides price information for each domain name to help users make purchasing decisions quickly.

Cons: The generated domain name suggestions are usually simple and sometimes not very creative. The analysis of SEO is relatively basic and cannot provide traffic data or competition analysis.

Page Title Optimization Tools These tools focus on generating efficient, SEO-friendly titles and URLs for landing pages (i.e. specific pages) to help improve page click-through rates and search engine rankings. Page name generation tools usually combine SEO data to determine the attractiveness and optimization effect of the title. 1.

Tacit knowledge, also known as implicit knowledge, is a type of knowledge that is difficult to formalize and personal, usually based on experience, intuition, and perception. Unlike explicit knowledge, tacit knowledge is difficult to convey through words, data, or formulas. It is often deeply embedded in an individual’s behavior, skills, or culture, and relies on practice and personal experience to acquire. For example, learning to ride a bicycle is a typical example of tacit knowledge. Although you can describe in words how to hold the handlebars, keep your balance, and pedal, these instructions cannot really convey how to keep your balance during actual riding. Only through repeated practice will you “understand” how to ride freely at a certain moment.

This type of knowledge often involves personal unique experience, technical know-how, intuition, etc., and is usually kept in the individual’s mind or in a restrictive environment within the organization. Explicit private knowledge: This knowledge is explicit but is limited to individuals or small groups. It can be recorded, but it is usually not disclosed to the outside world, perhaps because of company secrets, proprietary technology or personal privacy. Example: A company’s R\u0026D plan or strategic documents, although documented, can only be circulated within the company due to confidentiality measures and cannot be obtained by the outside world. Implicit private knowledge: This type of knowledge is typical implicit knowledge, usually rooted in personal experience, technology or intuition, difficult to express through language or written form, and only belongs to an individual or a few people.

The competitive advantage it brings is more lasting, especially in professional fields. Limitations: Private tacit knowledge is difficult to transfer and share, which means it can only be spread within individuals or a small range and is difficult to scale. In addition, this knowledge may be lost as the holders leave (such as retirement or resignation). Private explicit knowledge This kind of knowledge is also of high value because it is explicit but still private and is usually only spread within a limited circle, such as internal corporate documents, proprietary technology, or patent-protected innovations. It is highly protective and can be regulated and applied. Limitations: Although explicit knowledge is easier to transfer, its proprietary value will decrease once it is made public or leaked. Therefore, companies need to protect this knowledge through legal means (such as intellectual property rights). Public tacit knowledge This type of knowledge is relatively valuable because, although it is implicit, it can still be shared through a certain socialization process, usually transmitted in the form of practice, interaction, or experience, such as a common craft or interpersonal interaction skills in an industry. Limitations: Since the transmission of tacit knowledge requires interaction and practice, it cannot be popularized on a large scale and requires time and practice accumulation to master, so the speed of dissemination is slow. Public explicit knowledge The lowest value, because this type of knowledge is open to everyone and can be easily obtained (such as textbooks, public patents, academic papers). Due to its popularity, its competitive value in the market is low. Limitations: Public explicit knowledge lacks uniqueness due to its universality and is difficult to provide competitive advantages. In addition, the decontextualization of knowledge may not fully meet specific needs in practical applications, and it needs to be combined with practical experience and context to be effectively applied.

SECI represents four modes of knowledge conversion, namely: Socialization, Externalization, Combination, Internalization. These processes describe the mutual transformation between implicit knowledge and explicit knowledge. Socialization – From implicit knowledge to explicit knowledge Socialization is the process of transferring implicit knowledge through interaction or observation. For example, in a master-apprentice relationship, the apprentice acquires skills by observing the actual operation of the master, similar to the knowledge acquired through practice and shared experience. This process is usually not dependent on language, but is achieved through joint action and sharing of experience. Example: New employees gradually master some operational skills that are difficult to describe in writing by working with old employees and observing how they solve problems. Externalization – From implicit knowledge to explicit knowledge Externalization is the process of converting implicit knowledge into explicit knowledge, usually through discussion, analogy, model and other means to formalize the experience, intuition or skills that are difficult for individuals to express into documents or theories. This is a key step in knowledge creation, because implicit knowledge can only be more widely disseminated after it becomes explicit knowledge. Example: An experienced technician passes on his years of implicit experience to other members of the team by writing technical documents or tutorials. Combination – From explicit knowledge to explicit knowledge Combination is the process of organizing and recombining different explicit knowledge to create new explicit knowledge. Through the integration and analysis of information, a new knowledge framework is established and disseminated through reports, databases, etc. Example: An organization collects research results from different departments, summarizes them and forms a new strategic plan or product development plan. Internalization – From explicit knowledge to implicit knowledge Internalization is to transform explicit knowledge into individual implicit knowledge by learning and practicing it. This step is similar to “experiential learning”, that is, individuals form their own understanding and experience through the practice of explicit knowledge, which becomes potential implicit knowledge. Example: Employees learn the organization’s training manuals and apply what they have learned in actual work, eventually forming their own operating methods and skills.

In an organization, this conversion process can promote knowledge creation and innovation. When implicit knowledge is passed on to others through socialization and externalized into explicit knowledge, and explicit knowledge is further absorbed through combination and internalization, new implicit and explicit knowledge can be generated. This knowledge conversion is the core of organizational knowledge management, especially in innovative enterprises, by effectively utilizing employees’ implicit knowledge and converting it into explicit knowledge, it can bring continuous innovation and competitive advantages to the company. The SECI model can be visualized as a spiraling knowledge creation process, and the continuous conversion from implicit knowledge to explicit knowledge promotes the accumulation and development of knowledge.

SEM primarily relies on search engine advertising platforms like Google Ads or Bing Ads. Businesses bid on specific keywords to ensure their ads appear in relevant searches. When users search for these keywords, they see the ads you’ve bid on.

It can query and summarize relevant information in Google based on the target keywords entered by the user, and comes with corresponding content links. First, we need to create a Bot (if you are not sure how to create one, you can read a previous article), then click the “+” sign after “Workflow”: Enter the name and description of the workflow. Note that the name can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores, and must start with a letter. Then click “Confirm”: After that, enter the workflow editing page, and you can see that Coze will automatically generate the Start node and End node. On the left is the optional basic node mentioned above: First, we need to determine how to get the information we want from Google. In the past, we used to access the API directly by writing code to collect the information we need. In Coze, you can directly use plug-ins to complete this task. Click the “Plugin” button on the left, then select the Google Web Search plug-in and add it: The trigger of this workflow is the keyword entered by the user, so we need to configure a string type parameter in the Start node to receive the input text, named query here: The keyword information needs to flow to the Google Web Search plug-in, which completes the text processing and retrieval tasks. The operations here include: Set it to query in the previous step Connect the right side of the start node and the left side of the plug-in node to indicate the order between tasks In addition, we can also set two other parameters: num parameter: defines the maximum number of search results returned, the default is 10 start parameter: sets the number of pages to be searched, the default is 0, that is, the first page of search results At this time, we can first click “Test run” in the upper right corner to test the output effect. Here we input “chatgpt” as an example, and you can see that Coze took 3 seconds to successfully run this workflow. Click “Display result” in the upper right corner of the plug-in node to view the specific results of its processing task: I hope that the final output of this workflow includes: the title, description, and corresponding link of each search result. This information is mixed in the output results of the Google Web Search plug-in, so I need a Code node to extract this information. After placing the Code node between the plug-in node and the End node, set the input parameter to the output result of the plug-in node, and then click Edit in IDE to enter the code editing page: Currently, the Code node supports two languages ​​​​— Python and JavaScript. If you don’t know how to write code, you can also let the AI ​​write it for you by entering a natural language prompt in the built-in AI. After writing, click “Test Code” to test whether the code can run normally: After confirming that the code runs normally, we can test the operation of the entire workflow again. Although we can extract the corresponding result title, link, and summary from Google search results at this point, all the information is piled together, so we still need an LLM node to help us organize the information.

If you’ve ever stumbled upon a file with the .zst extension and wondered what kind of sorcery it is—don’t worry, you’re not alone. A ZST file is a compressed file format created using Zstandard (often shortened to zstd), a modern compression algorithm developed by Facebook. Think of it as the younger, faster cousin of more familiar formats like .zip or .gz. What makes .zst files special is their impressive balance between speed and compression ratio—they compress data quickly and decompress even faster, which is great for performance-critical applications. Zstandard is also highly tunable. You can dial up the compression level if you’re chasing a smaller file size, or ease it back if speed is more important. That flexibility has made it popular in everything from system package distributions (like Arch Linux or Fedora) to game asset compression.

As the value of k increases, the size of each cluster generally decreases, and therefore the distance of each point to its cluster center decreases, resulting in a decrease in SSE. Find the “elbow point”: Ideally, we want to find a small k value while keeping the SSE relatively small. When we plot the SSE corresponding to different k values, as the k value increases, the decline rate of SSE will slow down, and the curve will show an “elbow” shape. This “elbow point” is often considered the optimal number of clusters, as adding more clusters after this point does not significantly improve model fit (i.e., decrease in SSE) Taking into account the impact of random initialization: The KMeans algorithm randomly selects k clustering centers at the beginning, which may cause the algorithm results to be affected by the initial selection, making the final clustering result somewhat random. In order to obtain consistent results across multiple runs or different environments, we can set a random state. Here, by setting random_state=123, we ensure that the initial random selection of cluster centers is the same every time we run KMeans, making the results reproducible.

Increase in cluster centers: When we increase the number of clusters k, it means that more cluster centers can be used to represent data points. As the number of cluster centers increases, each data point is more likely to be assigned to a cluster center that is closer to it, so the average distance of each point to its cluster center will decrease, resulting in lower SSE. Decrease in cluster size: As the k value increases, the number of data points contained in each cluster usually decreases. Smaller clusters make data points within the cluster closer, reducing the distance between data points and their cluster centers, further reducing SSE. Extreme cases: In extreme cases, if the value of k is equal to the total number of data points, then each data point is its own cluster center, and the SSE will be 0. But this situation has no actual clustering significance and just illustrates why SSE will continue to decrease as k increases. #Use the KMeans clustering algorithm and specify the maximum number of clusters to test as 10 #KElbowVisualizer will evaluate k values from 1 to 10 to decide which k value is the best choice #Call the fit method to train the KMeans model elbow = KElbowVisualizer(KMeans(random_state=123), k=10) elbow.fit(df_final_scaled) elbow.show() The result of the run is a graph of different k values (number of clusters) and the corresponding SSE (sum of squared errors). The purpose of the elbow plot is to help us visually see how the SSE changes as the value of k increases. Ideally, SSE decreases as the k value increases, but the rate of decrease will slow down significantly at a certain point. This point is the so-called “elbow point” and is considered the optimal number of clusters.

It can be regarded as a smoothed version of the histogram. Through the KDE chart, we can intuitively understand the distribution of data, including the central tendency, dispersion and skewness of the data. Here are a few key points on how to interpret kernel density estimation plots: Peaks: The peaks on the KDE chart represent the mode area in the data, that is, there are more data points near this value. There can be multiple peaks on a plot, indicating that the data distribution may be multimodal (i.e., there are multiple modes). Width: The width of the graph reflects the variability or dispersion of the data. A kernel density plot with a larger width indicates that the data points are more dispersed; conversely, a plot with a narrower width indicates that the data points are more concentrated. Skewness: If the KDE plot is not completely symmetrical, the data distribution may be skewed. If the graph extends longer to the right, the data is positively skewed (right-skewed), that is, more data values are to the left of the mean; if the graph extends longer to the left, the data is negatively skewed (left-skewed), That is, more data values are to the right of the mean. Tails: The tail of the KDE plot can tell us the tail behavior of the data distribution, such as whether there is a long tail or extreme values. A long tail is when one end of the graph extends very far, indicating that there are some extreme high or low values. Overlay Plot: Sometimes, researchers will draw multiple KDE plots on the same graph to compare the data distribution of different subsets. At this time, you can understand the distribution differences between different subsets by observing which areas overlap more and the shape differences of each graph. Kernel density estimation and actual data: It should be noted that the kernel density estimation graph represents an estimate of the data distribution, not the actual data distribution. Therefore, it is useful for revealing overall trends in the data, but may not be suitable for precise statistical testing. Plot the kernel density estimates of “parent or not” and “total spent”: g = sns.FacetGrid(data=df, col='Cluster') g.map(sns.kdeplot, 'Is_Parent', 'Total_Spent', color='#95C8D8', fill=True) plt.text(0.6,3900, '0: Non Parent\\n1: Parent', weight='bold', fontsize=12) Plot the kernel density estimates of “number of children” and “total spent”: g = sns.FacetGrid(data=df, col='Cluster') g.map(sns.kdeplot, 'Kidhome', 'Total_Spent', color='#95C8D8', fill=True) Plot the kernel density estimates of “number of teenagers” and “total spent”: g = sns.FacetGrid(data=df, col='Cluster') g.map(sns.kdeplot, 'Teenhome', 'Total_Spent', color='#95C8D8', fill=True) Plot the kernel density estimates of “total children” and “total spent”: g = sns.FacetGrid(data=df, col='Cluster') g.map(sns.kdeplot, 'Total_Children', 'Total_Spent', color='#95C8D8', fill=True) Plot the kernel density estimates of “relationship status” and “total spent”: g = sns.FacetGrid(data=df, col='Cluster') g.map(sns.kdeplot, 'Living_With', 'Total_Spent', color='#95C8D8', fill=True) plt.text(0.7,3900, '0: Alone\\n1: Partner', weight='bold', fontsize=12) Draw a scatter plot of “education status” and “total spent”: g = sns.FacetGrid(data=df, col='Cluster') g.map(sns.scatterplot, 'Education', 'Total_Spent', color='#95C8D8') plt.text(0.6,3400, '0: Graduate\\n1: Postgraduate\\n2: Undergraduate', weight='bold', fontsize=12) ","date":"2024-04-07","objectID":"/posts/customer-profiling-and-segmentation/:6:2","tags":["Python"],"title":"Customer Profiling \u0026 Segmentation with Python (Source code)","uri":"/posts/customer-profiling-and-segmentation/"},{"categories":["Python"],"content":"How to analyze a scatter plot? Correlation Positive correlation: If an increase in one variable is accompanied by an increase in the other variable, then there is a positive correlation between the two variables. In a scatter plot, this appears as a general trend of the set of points from lower left to upper right. Negative correlation: If an increase in one variable is accompanied by a decrease in the other variable, then there is a negative correlation between the two variables. In a scatter plot, this appears as a general trend of the set of points from upper left to lower right. No correlation: If there is no obvious linear relationship between the two variables, the point set is relatively evenly distributed on the graph and there is no obvious trend. Clusters The points on a scatter plot sometimes form one or more clusters, indicating the presence of distinct subgroups in the data. These clusters may represent different categories, groups, or data points with similar characteristics. Outliers In a scatter plot, points that are far away from other data points are called outliers. These points may represent data entry errors, measurement errors, or actual data distribution properties. Trend Line Sometimes a trend line (such as a linear regression line) is added to a scatter plot to more clearly show the main trend between variables. The slope and direction of a trend line provide a visual representation of the relationship between variables. Distribution density In some scatter plots, the density of points reflects the concentration of data in that area. Areas with denser points indicate that there are more data points there.

The key to offline conversion tracking lies in “behavior matching”—connecting a user’s online activity to their offline conversions. Two common methods exist: Method 1: Through Ad Click IDs (e.g., GCLID, FBCID) When a user clicks an ad, the platform generates a unique ID attached to the landing page URL. Businesses must save this ID when the user submits a form or enters the CRM. If the user later converts, uploading this ID and conversion data to the ad platform completes the offline attribution. Method 2: Through User Identity Matching (e.g., phone number, email) If ad click IDs aren’t captured, conversions can still be matched by uploading customer details (e.g., phone numbers, emails, names). Platforms use encrypted data for fuzzy matching, linking conversions to past ad exposures.

In most cases, yes. Generally companies with overseas advertising specialist positions have the need to go overseas, so foreign language skills are a certain ability that will be assessed. Usually the requirement is at least IELTS 7 level (if you have relevant experience, you may be able to relax the requirement), some of the more demanding companies will ask you the specific grade 6 score, if it is just over the passing line, it may also be seen as a minus. For students majoring in minor languages, minor languages will be a plus for you, but you must also pass the English level. Will Google Ad Specialist be very busy? Do you need to work overtime a lot? If anyone has probably understood the position of overseas advertising specialist, they may have seen a lot of practitioners are discouraged to quit, citing “very serious overtime”, “no personal time”, “need to keep an eye on the account on holidays \" and so on. It must be admitted that overtime is a relatively common situation for this position, but it cannot be generalized. According to my own situation and the situation of related practitioners around me, whether overtime and the intensity of overtime will be affected by the following two factors: Party A \u0026 B Company There is also a distinction between A and B party companies for overseas advertising. Party A refers to companies that have self-developed products (games, software, physical products, etc.), and then hire specialized personnel to be responsible for overseas advertising of these products. A B-side company is a company that provides advertising management or consulting services for the A-side company, usually called an agency (advertising agency) in the industry. In the vast majority of cases, the overtime of Party B staff will be much more serious. Because Party A staff is responsible for the entire company’s product advertising accounts, while Party B staff usually have at least five clients’ advertising accounts on hand, each client needs to promote a different number of products. I learned that one of the scarier figures is that there is an optimizer in Baidu who had more than 100 accounts in his hands. So, obviously, don’t go to a B-side company if you can find an A-side job. When screening jobs and companies, it is actually easy to see whether the job belongs to the A-side or B-side. In the job postings appear similar to the words “advertiser”, “advertisers”, is basically the position of the second party company.
