As the value of k increases, the size of each cluster generally decreases, and therefore the distance of each point to its cluster center decreases, resulting in a decrease in SSE. Find the “elbow point”: Ideally, we want to find a small k value while keeping the SSE relatively small. When we plot the SSE corresponding to different k values, as the k value increases, the decline rate of SSE will slow down, and the curve will show an “elbow” shape. This “elbow point” is often considered the optimal number of clusters, as adding more clusters after this point does not significantly improve model fit (i.e., decrease in SSE) Taking into account the impact of random initialization: The KMeans algorithm randomly selects k clustering centers at the beginning, which may cause the algorithm results to be affected by the initial selection, making the final clustering result somewhat random. In order to obtain consistent results across multiple runs or different environments, we can set a random state. Here, by setting random_state=123, we ensure that the initial random selection of cluster centers is the same every time we run KMeans, making the results reproducible.

Increase in cluster centers: When we increase the number of clusters k, it means that more cluster centers can be used to represent data points. As the number of cluster centers increases, each data point is more likely to be assigned to a cluster center that is closer to it, so the average distance of each point to its cluster center will decrease, resulting in lower SSE. Decrease in cluster size: As the k value increases, the number of data points contained in each cluster usually decreases. Smaller clusters make data points within the cluster closer, reducing the distance between data points and their cluster centers, further reducing SSE. Extreme cases: In extreme cases, if the value of k is equal to the total number of data points, then each data point is its own cluster center, and the SSE will be 0. But this situation has no actual clustering significance and just illustrates why SSE will continue to decrease as k increases. #Use the KMeans clustering algorithm and specify the maximum number of clusters to test as 10 #KElbowVisualizer will evaluate k values from 1 to 10 to decide which k value is the best choice #Call the fit method to train the KMeans model elbow = KElbowVisualizer(KMeans(random_state=123), k=10) elbow.fit(df_final_scaled) elbow.show() The result of the run is a graph of different k values (number of clusters) and the corresponding SSE (sum of squared errors). The purpose of the elbow plot is to help us visually see how the SSE changes as the value of k increases. Ideally, SSE decreases as the k value increases, but the rate of decrease will slow down significantly at a certain point. This point is the so-called “elbow point” and is considered the optimal number of clusters.

It can be regarded as a smoothed version of the histogram. Through the KDE chart, we can intuitively understand the distribution of data, including the central tendency, dispersion and skewness of the data. Here are a few key points on how to interpret kernel density estimation plots: Peaks: The peaks on the KDE chart represent the mode area in the data, that is, there are more data points near this value. There can be multiple peaks on a plot, indicating that the data distribution may be multimodal (i.e., there are multiple modes). Width: The width of the graph reflects the variability or dispersion of the data. A kernel density plot with a larger width indicates that the data points are more dispersed; conversely, a plot with a narrower width indicates that the data points are more concentrated. Skewness: If the KDE plot is not completely symmetrical, the data distribution may be skewed. If the graph extends longer to the right, the data is positively skewed (right-skewed), that is, more data values are to the left of the mean; if the graph extends longer to the left, the data is negatively skewed (left-skewed), That is, more data values are to the right of the mean. Tails: The tail of the KDE plot can tell us the tail behavior of the data distribution, such as whether there is a long tail or extreme values. A long tail is when one end of the graph extends very far, indicating that there are some extreme high or low values. Overlay Plot: Sometimes, researchers will draw multiple KDE plots on the same graph to compare the data distribution of different subsets. At this time, you can understand the distribution differences between different subsets by observing which areas overlap more and the shape differences of each graph. Kernel density estimation and actual data: It should be noted that the kernel density estimation graph represents an estimate of the data distribution, not the actual data distribution. Therefore, it is useful for revealing overall trends in the data, but may not be suitable for precise statistical testing.

Correlation Positive correlation: If an increase in one variable is accompanied by an increase in the other variable, then there is a positive correlation between the two variables. In a scatter plot, this appears as a general trend of the set of points from lower left to upper right. Negative correlation: If an increase in one variable is accompanied by a decrease in the other variable, then there is a negative correlation between the two variables. In a scatter plot, this appears as a general trend of the set of points from upper left to lower right. No correlation: If there is no obvious linear relationship between the two variables, the point set is relatively evenly distributed on the graph and there is no obvious trend. Clusters The points on a scatter plot sometimes form one or more clusters, indicating the presence of distinct subgroups in the data. These clusters may represent different categories, groups, or data points with similar characteristics. Outliers In a scatter plot, points that are far away from other data points are called outliers. These points may represent data entry errors, measurement errors, or actual data distribution properties. Trend Line Sometimes a trend line (such as a linear regression line) is added to a scatter plot to more clearly show the main trend between variables. The slope and direction of a trend line provide a visual representation of the relationship between variables. Distribution density In some scatter plots, the density of points reflects the concentration of data in that area. Areas with denser points indicate that there are more data points there.

By doing this, a more seamless workflow is guaranteed, and switching between programs is less necessary. User UI and Ease of Use: You may greatly improve your experience with an intuitive, easy-to-navigate UI. Just think about how easy it is to add, modify, and share events, as well as quickly access your schedule. Collaboration and Sharing Features: Assess the app’s sharing features, such as how simple it is to share calendars with others, manage access rights, and work together on events. This is especially crucial for family planning and group endeavors. Customization and Flexibility: You may better manage your schedule by adding individualized reminders, color-coding events, and setting up several perspectives (day, week, and month) on your calendar. Cross-Platform Availability: Look for an app that enables cross-platform synchronization if you work in a diverse setting or use various devices. This guarantees that your calendar will be accessible and manageable from any device. Notifications and Reminders: You can remain on top of your schedule with the help of effective notification systems that let you set reminders, get notifications for future events, and be informed when shared events alter.

These actions could include activities such as purchases made in a physical store, phone calls to a business, or in-person transactions. The process generally begins with a unique identifier, like a Google Click ID (GCLID) or a Facebook Pixel, being assigned to each visitor who clicks on an online ad. This identifier is then saved along with any lead information collected from the individual. Later, when the customer performs an action offline - for example, making a purchase in a brick-and-mortar store - this offline activity is matched with the saved online click ID. If a match is found, the offline conversion can be attributed to the specific online ad campaign that initially led the customer to the business. Offline conversion tracking provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of online marketing campaigns. It helps businesses understand how their online ads are driving real-world outcomes, enabling them to optimize their strategies for better targeting and increased conversion rates.

Keyword competition score, also known as keyword difficulty score, is a metric used to measure the level of competition for a specific keyword in search engine results pages (SERPs). It’s a relative score that ranges from 0 to 100 and is calculated based on various factors such as the number of websites targeting the keyword, the quality of their content and backlinks, and the strength of their domain authority. A high keyword competition score indicates that it will be more difficult to rank for a particular keyword in search engine results. Conversely, a low keyword competition score suggests that it may be easier to rank for that keyword. Keyword competition score is an important metric to consider when conducting keyword research for SEO purposes. It helps you identify which keywords to target and prioritize based on their potential to drive traffic to your website and the level of effort required to achieve higher search engine rankings. Various tools like SEMrush, Ahrefs, and Moz provide keyword competition score metrics to assist in keyword research and planning.

One of the best ways to find low competition keywords is to use a keyword research tool. These tools can help you identify keywords with low competition, as well as provide information on the number of monthly searches and the estimated cost per click (CPC) for each keyword. There are several tools available that can help you find low competition keywords: Google Keyword Planner: Google Keyword Planner is a free tool that allows you to find keywords related to your business or industry. It also provides information on the level of competition, search volume, and estimated cost per click (CPC) for each keyword. Ahrefs: Ahrefs is a paid keyword research tool that provides detailed information on keyword difficulty, search volume, and related keywords. It also allows you to analyze your competitors' websites and their keyword rankings. SEMrush: SEMrush is another popular paid keyword research tool that provides detailed information on keyword difficulty, search volume, and related keywords. It also allows you to analyze your competitors' websites and their keyword rankings. Ubersuggest: Ubersuggest is a free keyword research tool that provides information on keyword difficulty, search volume, and related keywords. It also allows you to analyze your competitors' websites and their keyword rankings. Moz Keyword Explorer: Moz Keyword Explorer is a paid keyword research tool that provides information on keyword difficulty, search volume, and related keywords. It also provides information on the organic click-through rate (CTR) for each keyword, which can help you understand how many clicks you can expect to receive if you rank for a particular keyword. When using these tools, it’s important to keep in mind that keyword competition is just one factor to consider. You should also consider the relevance of the keyword to your business, the search volume, and the intent of the person searching for the keyword. By taking these factors into account, you can find the best keywords to target for your business. Another way to find low competition keywords is to look for long-tail keywords. Long-tail keywords are phrases that are more specific and targeted than shorter, more general keywords. Because they are more specific, they tend to have lower competition and can be easier to rank for. For example, instead of targeting the keyword “shoes,” you might target the long-tail keyword “women’s running shoes for flat feet.” ","date":"2023-04-05","objectID":"/posts/low-competition-keywords/:4:0","tags":["SEO"],"title":"How to Find Low Competition Keywords for SEO?","uri":"/posts/low-competition-keywords/"},{"categories":["SEO"],"content":"Other Factors that can Affect Keyword’s Competition While competition level is an important factor to consider when selecting keywords, it’s not the only factor that can affect your website’s ranking on search engines.

Relevance: Your keywords should be relevant to your business and the content on your website. If you target irrelevant keywords, your bounce rate may increase, which can negatively impact your ranking on search engines. User intent: Consider the intent of the person searching for the keyword.

While it’s important to target low competition keywords, that doesn’t mean you should avoid high-competition keywords altogether. High-competition keywords often have a higher search volume, which means there is more potential traffic to be gained from ranking for those keywords. Additionally, high-competition keywords may be more relevant to your business, and therefore may be worth the effort to rank for. However, it’s important to have realistic expectations when targeting high-competition keywords. Ranking for these keywords may require more time and effort, and you may not see results immediately. Additionally, you may need to invest in paid advertising to compete with other businesses for those keywords. In conclusion, finding low competition keywords is an important part of any digital marketing strategy.

In most cases, yes. Generally companies with overseas advertising specialist positions have the need to go overseas, so foreign language skills are a certain ability that will be assessed. Usually the requirement is at least IELTS 7 level (if you have relevant experience, you may be able to relax the requirement), some of the more demanding companies will ask you the specific grade 6 score, if it is just over the passing line, it may also be seen as a minus. For students majoring in minor languages, minor languages will be a plus for you, but you must also pass the English level. Will Google Ad Specialist be very busy? Do you need to work overtime a lot? If anyone has probably understood the position of overseas advertising specialist, they may have seen a lot of practitioners are discouraged to quit, citing “very serious overtime”, “no personal time”, “need to keep an eye on the account on holidays \" and so on. It must be admitted that overtime is a relatively common situation for this position, but it cannot be generalized. According to my own situation and the situation of related practitioners around me, whether overtime and the intensity of overtime will be affected by the following two factors: Party A \u0026 B Company There is also a distinction between A and B party companies for overseas advertising. Party A refers to companies that have self-developed products (games, software, physical products, etc.), and then hire specialized personnel to be responsible for overseas advertising of these products. A B-side company is a company that provides advertising management or consulting services for the A-side company, usually called an agency (advertising agency) in the industry. In the vast majority of cases, the overtime of Party B staff will be much more serious. Because Party A staff is responsible for the entire company’s product advertising accounts, while Party B staff usually have at least five clients' advertising accounts on hand, each client needs to promote a different number of products. I learned that one of the scarier figures is that there is an optimizer in Baidu who had more than 100 accounts in his hands. So, obviously, don’t go to a B-side company if you can find an A-side job. When screening jobs and companies, it is actually easy to see whether the job belongs to the A-side or B-side. In the job postings appear similar to the words “advertiser”, “advertisers”, is basically the position of the second party company. Promoted product types The more common types of products are: games, software, physical products (such as clothing, shoes and socks, accessories, etc.). For software and physical products, there will also be a distinction between C- and B-sides. Generally speaking, the overtime intensity is as follows (look at toB or toC first, then product type) C-side \u003e B-side Game \u003e physical product (partial e-commerce) \u003e software (non-game type) The size and magnitude of change of advertising traffic and the degree of market competition determine the frequency and intensity of your overtime. In addition, by the way, the overtime intensity of Google ad specialists is usually not as strong as that of Facebook ad specialists, because the algorithm mechanism of the two platforms is different, the latter has higher requirements for data continuity, and due to the existence of time differences, it usually requires the specialists to get up in the middle of the night to see if the account is abnormal. Is the Google Ad Specialist only responsible for Google channels? Can the experience be applied to other platforms? Google Ads specialists are usually only responsible for Google channels, but some smaller companies may have one specialist responsible for multiple channels (e.g. Facebook, Tiktok, Instagram, etc.).
