Tacit knowledge, also known as implicit knowledge, is a type of knowledge that is difficult to formalize and personal, usually based on experience, intuition, and perception. Unlike explicit knowledge, tacit knowledge is difficult to convey through words, data, or formulas. It is often deeply embedded in an individual’s behavior, skills, or culture, and relies on practice and personal experience to acquire. For example, learning to ride a bicycle is a typical example of tacit knowledge. Although you can describe in words how to hold the handlebars, keep your balance, and pedal, these instructions cannot really convey how to keep your balance during actual riding. Only through repeated practice will you “understand” how to ride freely at a certain moment. Similarly, the skills of a craftsman and the handling of complex interpersonal relationships require long-term practice to master, rather than relying solely on written knowledge.

For example, how a person judges the right time to communicate with others, this intuition is often difficult to summarize as explicit knowledge.

However, scholars further distinguish knowledge into public knowledge and private knowledge, which is a more detailed classification based on the sharing scope and accessibility of knowledge. This distinction helps us better understand the mobility of knowledge in society, organizations or individuals.

Explicit public knowledge: This kind of knowledge has been formalized, easy to spread and widely recognized. For example, textbooks, patents, laws and regulations, scientific papers, public industry standards, etc. are all explicit public knowledge. Example: Newton’s laws of mechanics in physics are explicit public knowledge because they can be found in textbooks and everyone can learn them. Implicit public knowledge: This type of knowledge is implicit but can be spread through specific social or learning occasions. For example, experience sharing or unwritten conventions in the industry can be acquired through participation in certain circles. Example: The working methods or culture within a certain industry, although not clearly defined, can be passed on through interactions in actual work. Although this knowledge is implicit, it may be well known within the industry.

This type of knowledge often involves personal unique experience, technical know-how, intuition, etc., and is usually kept in the individual’s mind or in a restrictive environment within the organization. Explicit private knowledge: This knowledge is explicit but is limited to individuals or small groups. It can be recorded, but it is usually not disclosed to the outside world, perhaps because of company secrets, proprietary technology or personal privacy. Example: A company’s R\u0026D plan or strategic documents, although documented, can only be circulated within the company due to confidentiality measures and cannot be obtained by the outside world. Implicit private knowledge: This type of knowledge is typical implicit knowledge, usually rooted in personal experience, technology or intuition, difficult to express through language or written form, and only belongs to an individual or a few people. Example: The operating skills of a skilled craftsman, although he can perform flawlessly, are difficult to teach to others through words, and only he can fully master them.

The competitive advantage it brings is more lasting, especially in professional fields. Limitations: Private tacit knowledge is difficult to transfer and share, which means it can only be spread within individuals or a small range and is difficult to scale. In addition, this knowledge may be lost as the holders leave (such as retirement or resignation). Private explicit knowledge This kind of knowledge is also of high value because it is explicit but still private and is usually only spread within a limited circle, such as internal corporate documents, proprietary technology, or patent-protected innovations. It is highly protective and can be regulated and applied. Limitations: Although explicit knowledge is easier to transfer, its proprietary value will decrease once it is made public or leaked. Therefore, companies need to protect this knowledge through legal means (such as intellectual property rights). Public tacit knowledge This type of knowledge is relatively valuable because, although it is implicit, it can still be shared through a certain socialization process, usually transmitted in the form of practice, interaction, or experience, such as a common craft or interpersonal interaction skills in an industry. Limitations: Since the transmission of tacit knowledge requires interaction and practice, it cannot be popularized on a large scale and requires time and practice accumulation to master, so the speed of dissemination is slow. Public explicit knowledge The lowest value, because this type of knowledge is open to everyone and can be easily obtained (such as textbooks, public patents, academic papers). Due to its popularity, its competitive value in the market is low. Limitations: Public explicit knowledge lacks uniqueness due to its universality and is difficult to provide competitive advantages. In addition, the decontextualization of knowledge may not fully meet specific needs in practical applications, and it needs to be combined with practical experience and context to be effectively applied.

SECI represents four modes of knowledge conversion, namely: Socialization, Externalization, Combination, Internalization. These processes describe the mutual transformation between implicit knowledge and explicit knowledge. Socialization – From implicit knowledge to explicit knowledge Socialization is the process of transferring implicit knowledge through interaction or observation. For example, in a master-apprentice relationship, the apprentice acquires skills by observing the actual operation of the master, similar to the knowledge acquired through practice and shared experience. This process is usually not dependent on language, but is achieved through joint action and sharing of experience. Example: New employees gradually master some operational skills that are difficult to describe in writing by working with old employees and observing how they solve problems. Externalization – From implicit knowledge to explicit knowledge Externalization is the process of converting implicit knowledge into explicit knowledge, usually through discussion, analogy, model and other means to formalize the experience, intuition or skills that are difficult for individuals to express into documents or theories. This is a key step in knowledge creation, because implicit knowledge can only be more widely disseminated after it becomes explicit knowledge. Example: An experienced technician passes on his years of implicit experience to other members of the team by writing technical documents or tutorials. Combination – From explicit knowledge to explicit knowledge Combination is the process of organizing and recombining different explicit knowledge to create new explicit knowledge. Through the integration and analysis of information, a new knowledge framework is established and disseminated through reports, databases, etc. Example: An organization collects research results from different departments, summarizes them and forms a new strategic plan or product development plan. Internalization – From explicit knowledge to implicit knowledge Internalization is to transform explicit knowledge into individual implicit knowledge by learning and practicing it. This step is similar to “experiential learning”, that is, individuals form their own understanding and experience through the practice of explicit knowledge, which becomes potential implicit knowledge. Example: Employees learn the organization’s training manuals and apply what they have learned in actual work, eventually forming their own operating methods and skills.

In an organization, this conversion process can promote knowledge creation and innovation. When implicit knowledge is passed on to others through socialization and externalized into explicit knowledge, and explicit knowledge is further absorbed through combination and internalization, new implicit and explicit knowledge can be generated. This knowledge conversion is the core of organizational knowledge management, especially in innovative enterprises, by effectively utilizing employees' implicit knowledge and converting it into explicit knowledge, it can bring continuous innovation and competitive advantages to the company. The SECI model can be visualized as a spiraling knowledge creation process, and the continuous conversion from implicit knowledge to explicit knowledge promotes the accumulation and development of knowledge.

Through this report, they found that some keywords have a high click-through rate (CTR), such as “solid wood furniture” and “modern style sofa”, while other keywords, such as “folding table” and “bedroom lamps”, have a low CTR and conversion rate. Click-through rate (CTR): A Home found that the click-through rate of “solid wood furniture” reached 6%, which is higher than the average, which means that this keyword has a strong appeal to the target users. Based on this finding, they decided to increase the budget for this keyword. Conversion rate: By observing the conversion rate of keywords, they found that although the CTR of “folding table” was low, the conversion rate was high, indicating that most of the users who clicked on this keyword were accurate purchase intention users. A Home therefore decided to keep this keyword and optimize it more accurately. Average cost per click (CPC): A Home analyzed the CPC and found that the CPC of “modern style sofa” was high, reaching $2.50 per click.

This shows that although mobile users are more likely to click on ads, they do not complete the purchase. Click-through rate (CTR): The CTR on mobile devices is 5.5%, higher than 4% on desktops, indicating that ads on mobile devices are more attractive to users. Conversion rate: However, the conversion rate on mobile is only 2%, much lower than the 5% on desktop.

They hope to analyze the advertising performance in different regions through the geographic location report to optimize the regional delivery strategy. Through analysis, they found that the advertising performance in some cities is very good, while other regions are mediocre. Click-through rate (CTR) by geographic location: They found that the CTR of first-tier cities such as Beijing and Shanghai is significantly higher than that of other regions, indicating that users in these regions are more interested in advertising. Conversion rate by geographic location: However, through the analysis of conversion rate, they found that although the conversion rate in the southwest region has a small number of clicks, the conversion rate is as high as 10%, which is higher than the conversion rate in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. This means that users in the southwest region have stronger purchasing intentions, and A Home Furnishing decided to increase advertising budgets in these regions and further expand advertising.

They found that many users did not buy immediately after clicking on the ad, but completed the conversion after browsing multiple product pages.

This suggests that A Home Furnishing needs to simplify the user’s browsing path, perhaps by optimizing website navigation or providing relevant product recommendations to increase conversion rates. Cost Per Conversion (CPA): Through CPA analysis, they found that the CPA of the “Bedroom Furniture Series” was high, reaching $50. This means that A Home Furnishing needs to optimize the advertising strategy for this series and reduce unnecessary advertising spending.

For example, by comparing the CTR and conversion rate of different campaigns, advertisers can clearly know which campaigns should increase their budgets. Time trend analysis: View the changing trend of advertising performance in different time periods (such as days, weeks, and months), helping advertisers to grasp the fluctuations in delivery effects and make timely adjustments. For example, if the CTR of a campaign suddenly drops on a certain day, you need to check whether the external factors or advertising settings of that day have changed. Cross analysis: Combine multiple indicators for cross analysis. For example, by combining CTR with conversion rate, advertisers can determine whether the advertisement can attract clicks and effectively convert; by combining CPC with conversion cost analysis, you can evaluate whether the advertising cost is reasonable.

For example, paying too much attention to click-through rate and ignoring conversion rate will result in a large number of clicks, but no actual business growth. Advertisers should combine multiple indicators to comprehensively evaluate the advertising effect. Ignoring external factors: Advertising effect is not only related to the delivery strategy, but also affected by external market factors. For example, holidays, industry off-seasons, policy changes, etc. will affect advertising performance. Therefore, when analyzing data, advertisers need to consider the potential impact of these external factors on advertising effect. Ignoring the long-tail effect: Some poorly performing keywords or campaigns may not perform well in the short term, but can bring good ROI in the long run. Advertisers should combine long-term data trends to avoid stopping certain campaigns prematurely due to short-term fluctuations. Misunderstanding the relationship between CPC and ROI: High CPC does not necessarily mean poor advertising performance, the key lies in ROI. If CPC is high, but the conversion rate is high and the revenue after conversion far exceeds the advertising expenditure, advertisers can still get a positive return on investment. Therefore, you cannot decide whether to lower the advertising bid based solely on CPC, but should consider the conversion effect comprehensively.

Why do my reports show high clicks but low conversion rates? High clicks but low conversion rates usually mean that users are interested in the ad, but the landing page or product after the ad fails to successfully attract them to convert. Possible reasons include: Poor landing page experience: If the landing page loads slowly, has an unattractive design, or lacks a clear call to action (CTA), users are likely to leave quickly after clicking the ad, resulting in a lower conversion rate. Mismatch between ad and landing page: If the ad content is inconsistent with the information on the landing page, users may be confused or disappointed. Ensuring consistency between ad copy and landing page information is key to improving conversion rates. Inaccurate audience targeting: If the audience targeted by the ad does not match the target population of the product, it will be difficult to generate effective conversions even with a large number of clicks. Adjust the audience, keywords, or placement of the ad to ensure that the ad is displayed to the most relevant potential customers. High competition: In some highly competitive industries, although users may click on the ad, the conversion rate may be affected because other brands have more attractive products or services. Recommendations: Optimize the user experience of your landing page, make sure the page loads quickly, and the information is concise and clear. Check the match between your ad copy and your landing page to make sure they complement each other. Re-examine your target audience to make sure your ad is only shown to users who are truly interested in your product.

How do I choose the report that’s best for me? Choosing the right AdWords report depends on your marketing goals and the scale of your campaign. Here are a few key considerations: Marketing goals: First, clarify what your advertising goals are - is it to increase brand awareness, increase website traffic, or increase sales and conversion rates? Different goals require different reports to track results. If your goal is to increase brand awareness, then impressions, click-through rate and other indicators are more important. If your goal is sales conversion, then conversion rate, CPA and other indicators directly related to sales are the focus. Ad type: Different ad formats require different reports. Text ads may be more suitable for viewing keyword performance reports, while display ads are suitable for viewing display ad performance reports. Audience targeting: If you are targeting different geographic locations, devices or interest groups when segmenting your audience or running ads, reports such as Device performance report and Geographic location report will help you analyze the advertising performance of different groups and optimize your delivery strategy. Budget and delivery scale: For large-scale advertising, it will be more efficient to choose reporting tools with automation functions (such as Swydo or ReportGarden). Small and medium-sized businesses can use free tools such as Google Data Studio for customized reports. Suggestions: Clarify your advertising goals and match the most relevant report type. Check the advertising performance report regularly to optimize the ad copy, audience and delivery strategy. Use automated reporting tools to save time and ensure real-time data updates.

Free Software Usually suitable for small and medium-sized enterprises or individual users, this type of software usually provides basic functions, such as limited keyword tracking, simple website audits, and partial competitor analysis. For example, some free SEO tools can help users understand the keyword rankings of their website, but due to functional and data limitations, they usually cannot provide in-depth analysis or comprehensive SEO recommendations. The advantage of free software is that it is free and can help novices quickly get started with the basic concepts of SEO, but its disadvantage is that the data accuracy and analysis depth are limited, especially when users need more complex functions. Paid Software Compared to free software, paid tools usually provide more functions, more detailed data, and more accurate analysis results. Paid software is suitable for businesses or professionals who need in-depth SEO analysis, such as large enterprises or SEO teams that need to manage multiple websites. Paid tools usually provide richer keyword tracking, detailed competitor analysis, in-depth website technical audits, and SEO improvement suggestions.

Local software Refers to SEO positioning tools that need to be installed on the user’s local computer or server. The advantage of this type of software is that the user has full control over the operation of the software, especially for some sensitive data, it is more secure. In addition, local software usually has no time limit and only requires a one-time purchase. However, the disadvantage of local software is the complexity of updating and maintenance. Users need to manually update the software regularly to keep up with changes in search engine algorithms. In addition, local software may have a certain impact on system performance, especially when performing large-scale data analysis. Cloud software Cloud search engine positioning software is based on cloud servers. Users do not need to install any software and can use it directly through a web browser. The main advantage of this type of software is convenience. Users can access it anytime and anywhere without worrying about software maintenance or updates. Cloud-based tools are usually automatically kept up to date with the latest search engine algorithms to ensure data accuracy. At the same time, cloud-based software is usually more powerful than local software because it can use cloud computing resources for large-scale data processing. However, the disadvantage of cloud-based software is that it requires an ongoing paid subscription, and some companies may be cautious about hosting SEO data on external servers, especially when sensitive information is involved.

Thorough research The first step to writing a good SEM copy is thorough research and planning, including: Identify your unique selling proposition (USP) USP (Unique selling proposition) refers to the unique advantages of your product or service compared to your competitors. In this step, you need to identify the needs, pain points and preferences of your target users, analyze the user’s purchase decision process, and understand the factors they care about (such as price, quality, service, etc.). Method: Conduct market research and user interviews to obtain direct feedback. Create user portraits to depict the characteristics and behavior patterns of typical customers. Tools: SurveyMonkey or Google Forms: for designing and distributing online questionnaires. HubSpot Persona Generator: create detailed user portraits. Keyword research Keywords are words that users enter into search engines. Through effective keyword research, you can identify the user’s search intent and needs, thereby optimizing your copy and increasing the visibility and click-through rate of your ads. The most important thing in this step is to determine the user’s true search intent, that is, to understand the user’s goal when searching, whether to obtain information, compare products or purchase directly. At the same time, you need to determine the classification of keywords, including informational keywords, transactional keywords, etc. Method: Analyze relevant topics and questions that users may ask to help identify potential keywords. Observe social media and forums to understand the hot spots and concerns of user discussions. Use keyword tools to find related keywords and analyze the potential of each keyword. Focus on long-tail keywords, which usually have less competition and higher conversion rates. Tools: AnswerThePublic: Generate questions related to specific topics to help identify informational keywords. Google Trends: Analyze the search trends and popularity of keywords. Google Keyword Planner: Provides keyword search volume and competition to help formulate advertising strategies. SEMrush or Ahrefs: Analyze keyword rankings and traffic potential. Landing Page Consistency The landing page is the page that users visit after clicking on an ad. Ensuring that your ad copy is consistent with the content of the landing page to provide a consistent user experience is key to improving conversion rates. What the ad copy promises must be met on the landing page to avoid disappointment for users. Method: Compare ad copy and landing page content to ensure that key points and value propositions are consistent. Use similar titles and descriptions to enhance user trust. Tools: Grammarly: Check for consistency and grammatical errors in copy. Google Optimize: Test different versions of landing pages and observe conversion effects. Competitive SEM Copy Analysis Collect and study competitors' SEM copy, analyze their successes and shortcomings, find opportunities for improvement and differentiation, and develop more effective copy strategies. Method: Use your keywords in the search engine and observe the ads of top-ranked competitors. Save ad copy and screenshots for subsequent analysis. Compare your USP with competitor copy and identify areas for improvement. Tools: SWOT Analysis Tool: Helps you systematically evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of your competitors. SEMrush: View competitor advertising history and strategies. AdSpy: Analyze competitor ads on social media and search engines.

Start writing Before discussing more detailed writing techniques, it is important to make it clear that no matter what your product or service is, the core principle of SEM copywriting is: cater to the pain points of your target audience. Once you deviate from this principle, your ad conversion rate will definitely be negatively affected (even if the click-through rate is good). When writing SEM copy, the key is how to attract users and prompt them to take action. Let’s take an environmentally friendly water bottle as an example. This product not only solves the needs of users, but also has a sense of social responsibility. We will use several key elements to show how to write effective SEM copy so that it can not only capture the attention of the target audience but also increase conversion rates. Insert target keywords Naturally integrate relevant keywords into the copy to increase the search visibility and click-through rate of the ad. Suppose you sell environmentally friendly water bottles, the keywords can be “reusable water bottles” and “environmentally friendly water bottles”. Positive Example: Ad Title: “Eco-friendly water bottles, help you reduce plastic waste” Description: “Buy our reusable water bottles and enjoy 10% off! Keep drinking water healthy and save the planet!” Negative Example: Title: “Come here to buy water bottles!” Description: “We have a lot of choices!” (No keywords used) Through effective keyword insertion, users are more likely to find your ads when searching, increasing click-through rates, while negative examples may cause your ads to be ignored. Social Testimonials and Public Recommendations Use user reviews and testimonials to enhance the credibility of your ads. Social testimonials can help build trust with potential customers, especially in a competitive market. Customers who see positive feedback from other users are more likely to click on your ads and ultimately purchase. Positive Case: Quote real user reviews in ads, such as: “This water bottle has really changed my life. It is convenient and environmentally friendly! - Miss Zhang” Negative Case: “Our water bottle is very useful. Welcome to buy it!” (Lack of specific user feedback) The negative case lacks specific user recommendations, which may cause customers to doubt and be unwilling to buy. Strong and clear CTA (call to action) CTA is a key element to guide users to take action and must be concise and clear. A clear CTA can eliminate users' doubts and clearly tell them what to do next, thereby increasing conversion rates. Positive Case: Use a strong CTA in ads, such as: “Buy now and enjoy a limited-time 10% discount!” Negative Case: “Want to learn more?” (vague and unclear) The negative case does not clearly guide users to the next step, which may cause potential customers to feel confused and miss the opportunity to buy. Use numbers and statistics Numbers and statistics can effectively enhance the persuasiveness of copywriting. Specific numbers make the copy more authoritative, better able to attract users' attention and enhance their confidence in buying. Positive case: “90% of users reported that using our environmentally friendly water bottles reduced plastic use by 30%!” Negative case: “Our water bottles are very popular!” The lack of specific data in the negative case makes the ad unconvincing, and users may not be convinced, reducing their willingness to click and buy. Create a sense of urgency Motivate users to act quickly through time limits or scarcity. The sense of urgency can stimulate users' desire to buy, prevent them from delaying decisions, and increase conversion rates. Positive case: “Only 100 water bottles left, hurry up and buy! The event is limited to 48 hours!” Negative case: “We always have stock, welcome to buy!” The lack of urgency in the negative case may cause users to delay decision-making and miss the opportunity to buy.

Test and Optimization A/B Test A/B test is an experimental method that compares two different versions of ad copy (version A and version B) at the same time to evaluate which version performs better, thereby improving the click-through rate (CTR) and conversion rate (CVR) of SEM copy. It includes the following steps: Clear goal: Determine the goal of the test, such as improving click-through rate or increasing purchase conversion. Select variables: Select specific elements to be tested, such as titles, descriptions, CTA, etc. Create two versions: Design version A and version B, and ensure that other conditions remain consistent for easy comparison. Randomly assign traffic: Randomly assign users to the two versions to ensure that each version receives the same amount of traffic. Collect data: Monitor the performance of each version and record key indicators such as click-through rate, conversion rate, etc. Analyze results: Evaluate which version performs better and make decisions based on data. Implement optimization: Select the best performing version and launch it in the ad, while considering continuing to test other variables. Some tools that can be used for SEM copy A/B testing: Google Optimize: A powerful tool for performing A/B testing, suitable for testing websites and ad copy. Optimizely: Provides a comprehensive A/B testing solution, easy to use, suitable for all types of companies. VWO (Visual Website Optimizer): Can perform A/B testing, split testing, etc., with a friendly interface, suitable for beginners. Adobe Target: An enterprise-level A/B testing tool suitable for large-scale advertising testing. Use ad extensions In SEM advertising, ad extensions are an important tool to enhance advertising effectiveness, providing additional information and interactive options, ultimately achieving higher conversion rates. Sitelink Add additional links to different parts of the website, such as product pages, customer reviews, or FAQs, to help users quickly find the information they need and increase the chance of clicking. For example: in an eco-friendly water bottle ad, add links to the pages of “Customer Reviews”, “Environmental Concepts”, and “Purchase Options”. Users can directly visit these links to learn more about the relevant information. Callout Add a short text to the ad to highlight the unique advantages of the product, such as “BPA-free”, “Free Shipping”, and “30-day Money Back Guarantee”, to enhance the attractiveness of the ad, provide more information that users care about, and encourage them to click on the ad. For example: In the eco-friendly water bottle ad text, include additional instructions such as “Eco-friendly Water Bottle, Free Shipping, 30-day Money Back Guarantee!” to make users feel the extra value. Structured Snippet Show specific features of a product or service, such as “color”, “brand”, “type”, etc. Provide users with key information to help them make faster choices during the decision-making process. For example: In an ad for an eco-friendly water bottle, use a structured snippet such as “Color: Blue, Green, Red” to help users quickly understand the available colors. Location extension Show the business address and provide a map link in the ad to help users find the physical store location, thereby increasing store traffic. This is especially effective for physical stores or service providers. Call extension Add a phone number to the ad so that users can call directly for consultation, making it easier for users to get more information and increase consultation and conversion rates. Price extension Show the price of a product or service in the ad to help users quickly understand the cost information. Improve price transparency and attract price-sensitive customers. For example: In an ad for an eco-friendly water bottle, displaying “Only $19.99” directly lets users know the price, thereby increasing their desire to buy.

Note that the name can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores, and must start with a letter. Then click “Confirm”: After that, enter the workflow editing page, and you can see that Coze will automatically generate the Start node and End node. On the left is the optional basic node mentioned above: First, we need to determine how to get the information we want from Google. In the past, we used to access the API directly by writing code to collect the information we need. In Coze, you can directly use plug-ins to complete this task. Click the “Plugin” button on the left, then select the Google Web Search plug-in and add it: The trigger of this workflow is the keyword entered by the user, so we need to configure a string type parameter in the Start node to receive the input text, named query here: The keyword information needs to flow to the Google Web Search plug-in, which completes the text processing and retrieval tasks. The operations here include: Set it to query in the previous step Connect the right side of the start node and the left side of the plug-in node to indicate the order between tasks In addition, we can also set two other parameters: num parameter: defines the maximum number of search results returned, the default is 10 start parameter: sets the number of pages to be searched, the default is 0, that is, the first page of search results At this time, we can first click “Test run” in the upper right corner to test the output effect. Here we input “chatgpt” as an example, and you can see that Coze took 3 seconds to successfully run this workflow. Click “Display result” in the upper right corner of the plug-in node to view the specific results of its processing task: I hope that the final output of this workflow includes: the title, description, and corresponding link of each search result. This information is mixed in the output results of the Google Web Search plug-in, so I need a Code node to extract this information. After placing the Code node between the plug-in node and the End node, set the input parameter to the output result of the plug-in node, and then click Edit in IDE to enter the code editing page: Currently, the Code node supports two languages ​​​​— Python and JavaScript.

Workflow Store: A “workflow” is an organized series of steps to accomplish a task. For a complex task, we need to disassemble it into individual steps, and then connect each step according to a preset process and action, so as to automate the task and reduce the repetitive operations of manual labor.

As the value of k increases, the size of each cluster generally decreases, and therefore the distance of each point to its cluster center decreases, resulting in a decrease in SSE. Find the “elbow point”: Ideally, we want to find a small k value while keeping the SSE relatively small. When we plot the SSE corresponding to different k values, as the k value increases, the decline rate of SSE will slow down, and the curve will show an “elbow” shape. This “elbow point” is often considered the optimal number of clusters, as adding more clusters after this point does not significantly improve model fit (i.e., decrease in SSE) Taking into account the impact of random initialization: The KMeans algorithm randomly selects k clustering centers at the beginning, which may cause the algorithm results to be affected by the initial selection, making the final clustering result somewhat random. In order to obtain consistent results across multiple runs or different environments, we can set a random state. Here, by setting random_state=123, we ensure that the initial random selection of cluster centers is the same every time we run KMeans, making the results reproducible.

Increase in cluster centers: When we increase the number of clusters k, it means that more cluster centers can be used to represent data points. As the number of cluster centers increases, each data point is more likely to be assigned to a cluster center that is closer to it, so the average distance of each point to its cluster center will decrease, resulting in lower SSE. Decrease in cluster size: As the k value increases, the number of data points contained in each cluster usually decreases. Smaller clusters make data points within the cluster closer, reducing the distance between data points and their cluster centers, further reducing SSE. Extreme cases: In extreme cases, if the value of k is equal to the total number of data points, then each data point is its own cluster center, and the SSE will be 0. But this situation has no actual clustering significance and just illustrates why SSE will continue to decrease as k increases. #Use the KMeans clustering algorithm and specify the maximum number of clusters to test as 10 #KElbowVisualizer will evaluate k values from 1 to 10 to decide which k value is the best choice #Call the fit method to train the KMeans model elbow = KElbowVisualizer(KMeans(random_state=123), k=10) elbow.fit(df_final_scaled) elbow.show() The result of the run is a graph of different k values (number of clusters) and the corresponding SSE (sum of squared errors). The purpose of the elbow plot is to help us visually see how the SSE changes as the value of k increases. Ideally, SSE decreases as the k value increases, but the rate of decrease will slow down significantly at a certain point. This point is the so-called “elbow point” and is considered the optimal number of clusters.

It can be regarded as a smoothed version of the histogram. Through the KDE chart, we can intuitively understand the distribution of data, including the central tendency, dispersion and skewness of the data. Here are a few key points on how to interpret kernel density estimation plots: Peaks: The peaks on the KDE chart represent the mode area in the data, that is, there are more data points near this value. There can be multiple peaks on a plot, indicating that the data distribution may be multimodal (i.e., there are multiple modes). Width: The width of the graph reflects the variability or dispersion of the data. A kernel density plot with a larger width indicates that the data points are more dispersed; conversely, a plot with a narrower width indicates that the data points are more concentrated. Skewness: If the KDE plot is not completely symmetrical, the data distribution may be skewed. If the graph extends longer to the right, the data is positively skewed (right-skewed), that is, more data values are to the left of the mean; if the graph extends longer to the left, the data is negatively skewed (left-skewed), That is, more data values are to the right of the mean. Tails: The tail of the KDE plot can tell us the tail behavior of the data distribution, such as whether there is a long tail or extreme values. A long tail is when one end of the graph extends very far, indicating that there are some extreme high or low values. Overlay Plot: Sometimes, researchers will draw multiple KDE plots on the same graph to compare the data distribution of different subsets. At this time, you can understand the distribution differences between different subsets by observing which areas overlap more and the shape differences of each graph. Kernel density estimation and actual data: It should be noted that the kernel density estimation graph represents an estimate of the data distribution, not the actual data distribution. Therefore, it is useful for revealing overall trends in the data, but may not be suitable for precise statistical testing.

Correlation Positive correlation: If an increase in one variable is accompanied by an increase in the other variable, then there is a positive correlation between the two variables. In a scatter plot, this appears as a general trend of the set of points from lower left to upper right. Negative correlation: If an increase in one variable is accompanied by a decrease in the other variable, then there is a negative correlation between the two variables. In a scatter plot, this appears as a general trend of the set of points from upper left to lower right. No correlation: If there is no obvious linear relationship between the two variables, the point set is relatively evenly distributed on the graph and there is no obvious trend. Clusters The points on a scatter plot sometimes form one or more clusters, indicating the presence of distinct subgroups in the data. These clusters may represent different categories, groups, or data points with similar characteristics. Outliers In a scatter plot, points that are far away from other data points are called outliers. These points may represent data entry errors, measurement errors, or actual data distribution properties. Trend Line Sometimes a trend line (such as a linear regression line) is added to a scatter plot to more clearly show the main trend between variables.

These actions could include activities such as purchases made in a physical store, phone calls to a business, or in-person transactions. The process generally begins with a unique identifier, like a Google Click ID (GCLID) or a Facebook Pixel, being assigned to each visitor who clicks on an online ad. This identifier is then saved along with any lead information collected from the individual. Later, when the customer performs an action offline - for example, making a purchase in a brick-and-mortar store - this offline activity is matched with the saved online click ID. If a match is found, the offline conversion can be attributed to the specific online ad campaign that initially led the customer to the business. Offline conversion tracking provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of online marketing campaigns. It helps businesses understand how their online ads are driving real-world outcomes, enabling them to optimize their strategies for better targeting and increased conversion rates.

I have pushed new products, been in charge of high net worth products, experienced the whole account being blocked, and recently started to learn to recruit competent subordinates. Although the market situation is not optimistic in these years, from my personal experience, from the perspective of salary and market demand, overseas advertising specialist is still a good career choice.

In most cases, yes. Generally companies with overseas advertising specialist positions have the need to go overseas, so foreign language skills are a certain ability that will be assessed. Usually the requirement is at least IELTS 7 level (if you have relevant experience, you may be able to relax the requirement), some of the more demanding companies will ask you the specific grade 6 score, if it is just over the passing line, it may also be seen as a minus. For students majoring in minor languages, minor languages will be a plus for you, but you must also pass the English level. Will Google Ad Specialist be very busy? Do you need to work overtime a lot? If anyone has probably understood the position of overseas advertising specialist, they may have seen a lot of practitioners are discouraged to quit, citing “very serious overtime”, “no personal time”, “need to keep an eye on the account on holidays \" and so on. It must be admitted that overtime is a relatively common situation for this position, but it cannot be generalized. According to my own situation and the situation of related practitioners around me, whether overtime and the intensity of overtime will be affected by the following two factors: Party A \u0026 B Company There is also a distinction between A and B party companies for overseas advertising. Party A refers to companies that have self-developed products (games, software, physical products, etc.), and then hire specialized personnel to be responsible for overseas advertising of these products. A B-side company is a company that provides advertising management or consulting services for the A-side company, usually called an agency (advertising agency) in the industry. In the vast majority of cases, the overtime of Party B staff will be much more serious. Because Party A staff is responsible for the entire company’s product advertising accounts, while Party B staff usually have at least five clients' advertising accounts on hand, each client needs to promote a different number of products. I learned that one of the scarier figures is that there is an optimizer in Baidu who had more than 100 accounts in his hands. So, obviously, don’t go to a B-side company if you can find an A-side job. When screening jobs and companies, it is actually easy to see whether the job belongs to the A-side or B-side. In the job postings appear similar to the words “advertiser”, “advertisers”, is basically the position of the second party company. Promoted product types The more common types of products are: games, software, physical products (such as clothing, shoes and socks, accessories, etc.). For software and physical products, there will also be a distinction between C- and B-sides. Generally speaking, the overtime intensity is as follows (look at toB or toC first, then product type) C-side \u003e B-side Game \u003e physical product (partial e-commerce) \u003e software (non-game type) The size and magnitude of change of advertising traffic and the degree of market competition determine the frequency and intensity of your overtime. In addition, by the way, the overtime intensity of Google ad specialists is usually not as strong as that of Facebook ad specialists, because the algorithm mechanism of the two platforms is different, the latter has higher requirements for data continuity, and due to the existence of time differences, it usually requires the specialists to get up in the middle of the night to see if the account is abnormal. Is the Google Ad Specialist only responsible for Google channels? Can the experience be applied to other platforms? Google Ads specialists are usually only responsible for Google channels, but some smaller companies may have one specialist responsible for multiple channels (e.g. Facebook, Tiktok, Instagram, etc.). Regarding whether the experience can be reused, it needs to be judged according to different platform placement and algorithm mec","date":"2023-01-26","objectID":"/posts/what-does-a-google-ads-specialist-do/:2:0","tags":["SEM","Google Ads"],"title":"What does a Google Ads Specialist do?","uri":"/posts/what-does-a-google-ads-specialist-do/"},{"categories":["SEM"],"content":"Job Description The daily work of Google Ads Specialist includes the following.

The posts folder stores all blog posts, and my-first-post.md is the new article file just created. You can edit this file to write the content of the article. Article files are usually in markdown format, containing Front Matter information such as article title, release time, tags, categories, and body content. static: If images or other static resources are referenced in the article, these resources need to be placed in the static folder, and Hugo will copy them to the final generated site. config.toml: Some global configurations (such as the website language, default theme, menu, etc.) may affect the display of new articles.
