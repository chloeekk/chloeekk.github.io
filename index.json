In the battleground of Search Engine Marketing (SEM), running ads is only half the battle. What truly sets you apart and even helps you surpass competitors is SEM analysis. It acts as the “eyes” and “brain” of your ad strategy, helping you understand what happened, why it happened, and what you should do next. Simply put, SEM analysis is the systematic process of collecting, measuring, analyzing, and reporting data related to search engine marketing. This data includes, but is not limited to: how many times your ads were seen (impressions), how many times they were clicked (clicks), how many conversions they generated (conversions), and how much you paid for them (ad spend). By digging deep into this data, you can comprehensively evaluate ad campaign performance, identify potential optimization opportunities, and provide solid data support for future marketing strategies. Without SEM analysis, your ad campaigns are like walking in the dark. You wouldn’t know which keywords are effective, which ad copies are appealing, which landing pages drive conversions, or if every penny spent is worthwhile. This not only means significant resource waste but also could lead you to miss market opportunities.

You already know the importance of SEM analysis, but when faced with dense numbers in Google Ads reports, where do you even begin? Just as a doctor needs to monitor key vital signs to diagnose an illness, SEM analysis also has a set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Understanding and continuously tracking these KPIs is the foundation for effective analysis and optimization of ad performance. These metrics can be divided into several categories: ","date":"2025-09-13","objectID":"/posts/sem-analytics/:2:0","tags":["SEM","Digital Marketing","Google Ads"],"title":"The Ultimate Guide to SEM Data Analysis","uri":"/posts/sem-analytics/"},{"categories":["SEM","Digital Marketing"],"content":"Traffic Metrics: Ad Visibility and Appeal These metrics primarily reflect how many times your ads were seen and whether users were attracted to them and clicked. Impressions: The total number of times your ad was displayed on search results pages or other Google networks. This metric measures your ad visibility. High impressions mean your ad has significant exposure, but it doesn’t directly represent effectiveness. This metric is particularly important during brand awareness campaigns or when you need to check if keywords have sufficient search volume. Clicks: The total number of times users actually clicked your ad. This indicates that users were interested in your ad content or product/service. In any ad campaign, especially those aiming to acquire traffic, clicks are a core metric. Click-Through Rate (CTR): Formula: $$(\\text{Clicks} / \\text{Impressions}) \\times 100%$$ CTR is a very important metric that measures your ad’s attractiveness and relevance to users. A high CTR indicates that your ad copy, keyword targeting, and ad extensions are performing well, effectively attracting your target audience. Additionally, CTR is one of the key factors influencing Ad Quality Score. Continuously monitoring CTR is crucial because a low CTR could mean poor ad copy, low keyword relevance, or imprecise ad targeting. You can improve it by optimizing your “Key Techniques for Writing High-Converting SEM Copy” and using relevant ad extensions.

Cost Per Click (CPC): Formula: $$\\text{Total Cost} / \\text{Clicks}$$ The average cost you pay for each ad click. This is a core metric for measuring ad cost efficiency. A high CPC will directly consume your budget, reducing your return on investment. You need to continuously monitor CPC and check if you can lower it by improving your Quality Score, as mentioned in “The Core Mechanism of SEM Bidding: Ad Rank and Quality Score”, or by adjusting your bidding strategy. Total Cost: The total amount spent on your ad campaigns within a specific period. This is the basis for budget management, and you need to monitor it daily, weekly, and monthly to ensure ad spend stays within budget. Average Position / Ranking Position (Avg. Position / Top of Page / Absolute Top): Average Position: This was an early Google Ads metric indicating the average position of an ad on the search results page. Impressions (Top) %: The percentage of times your ad was displayed at the top of the search results page. Impressions (Abs. Top) %: The percentage of times your ad was displayed in the very first position on the search results page. These metrics reflect your ad’s visibility and competitiveness on the page. Higher positions usually mean higher CTR and more clicks, but they might also mean higher CPC. These metrics are crucial when you have clear requirements for ad visibility and position, such as in brand awareness campaigns or when striving for an advantage in fierce competition.

Conversions: The number of times users complete your predefined target actions, such as purchasing a product, filling out a form, downloading a resource, making a phone call, etc. This is the most important metric for measuring the business results of your ad campaigns, and you should always monitor it, as it is the ultimate indicator of ad campaign success. Conversion Rate: Formula: $$(\\text{Conversions} / \\text{Clicks}) \\times 100%$$ Conversion Rate measures the efficiency with which your ads and landing pages convert clicking users into target customers. A high conversion rate means your ads attracted the right audience, and your landing page effectively guided them to convert. You need to continuously monitor conversion rate; a low conversion rate might indicate that your ad message doesn’t match your landing page, or that the landing page experience is poor. Improving conversion rate is a core goal of “The Ultimate Guide to Landing Page Optimization”. Cost Per Acquisition/Action (CPA): Formula: $$\\text{Total Cost} / \\text{Conversions}$$ The average cost required to acquire one conversion. This is a key metric for evaluating the profitability and efficiency of your ad campaigns. An ideal CPA should be lower than the profit you gain from each conversion. You need to continuously monitor CPA to ensure it stays within an acceptable range to maintain profitability. Conversion Value: The total value generated by all conversions. For e-commerce or businesses that can assign value to different conversion actions (e.g., a high-value product inquiry conversion is worth more than a resource download), this metric is crucial. Return On Ad Spend (ROAS): Formula: $$(\\text{Conversion Value} / \\text{Total Cost}) \\times 100%$$ ROAS measures how much conversion value is generated for every unit of ad spend. It directly reflects the profitability and efficiency of your ad investment. For example, a 200% ROAS means that for every $1 spent on advertising, $2 in sales revenue is generated. ROAS is one of the ultimate metrics for measuring overall effectiveness for e-commerce and all profit-oriented ad campaigns.

Average Session Duration: The average time users spend on your landing page. Longer session durations usually indicate that users are interested in the page content and are interacting with it. You need to monitor this to gauge content appeal and user engagement. Too short a duration might mean the page content doesn’t meet expectations or is difficult to understand. Bounce Rate: The percentage of users who visit only one page of your landing page and then leave. A high bounce rate is usually a warning sign, possibly indicating that the landing page failed to meet user expectations or has usability issues. You need to continuously monitor bounce rate, as it can severely impact conversion rates and Ad Quality Score. Exit Rate: The percentage of users who leave the website from a specific page after visiting your landing page (and possibly other pages). This metric can help you identify breakpoints or end points in the user journey, allowing you to optimize the user flow. Page Load Speed: The time it takes for the landing page to fully load. Load speed is the foundation of user experience. Slow page loading leads to user abandonment, especially on mobile devices, and negatively affects Ad Quality Score.

Keyword-Level Optimization: Improving Traffic Quality and Cost Efficiency Keywords are the first bridge connecting ads and users, and an important entry point for data analysis and optimization. Identify High-Cost, Low-Conversion Keywords: Analyze your keyword report in depth to find keywords that have high spend but very few conversions or excessively high Cost Per Acquisition (CPA). Actionable Strategy: For these keywords, you can choose to pause them, lower bids, or check if their ad copy and landing pages are sufficiently relevant. Identify Low Click-Through Rate (CTR) Keywords: Pay attention to keywords with high impressions but CTR significantly below average. This might mean your ad copy isn’t appealing enough for the search intent of these keywords, or relevance is insufficient. Actionable Strategy: Try to improve ad copy to better match the keywords, or move them to more relevant ad groups for more targeted ads. Discover New High-Potential Keywords: Check the Search Term Report. This shows what terms users actually searched for that triggered your ads. You might find unexpected but highly relevant and high-converting long-tail keywords. Actionable Strategy: Add these valuable search terms as new exact match keywords and create dedicated ad groups and copy to capture this high-quality traffic. This is discussed in more detail in “Keyword Research and Targeting in the AI Era”. Continuously Add Negative Keywords: In the search term report, you’ll also find some irrelevant or unclear search terms. For example, if you sell new products, users searching for “used [your product]” are unlikely to convert.

Judging whether ad data is good or bad isn’t about looking at a single number; it requires a holistic evaluation combining your business goals, industry benchmarks, and historical performance. Align with Business Goals: Is your campaign aimed at increasing brand awareness, acquiring leads, or driving sales? If the goal is brand awareness, you’ll likely focus more on impressions and Click-Through Rate (CTR). If the goal is leads or sales, then conversions, conversion rate, Cost Per Acquisition (CPA), and Return On Ad Spend (ROAS) are key. If your CPA is lower than your profit expectation and ROAS is well above your investment, the data is generally “good.” Refer to Industry Benchmarks: What are the average CTR, CPA, and ROAS in your industry? While every account is unique, industry averages provide a general reference range. You can find this through third-party reports or tools (like benchmark data provided by Google Ads). Additionally, you can use our calculator tools to quickly calculate and analyze your metrics, comparing them against industry averages. Compare with Historical Data: Compare your ad data against previous weeks, months, or the same period last year to see if it’s trending up or down. Consistent improvement is what truly defines “good.” Compare with Other Campaigns: If you’re running multiple campaigns, compare their performance. Identify the best-performing ones and analyze their success factors; for the worst-performing ones, look for optimization points.

Analysis frequency depends on your ad budget, campaign type, rate of change, and team resources. There’s no one-size-fits-all answer, but you can refer to these suggestions: Daily Monitoring: Quickly check core metric overviews (e.g., cost, clicks, conversions, CPA) daily to ensure no unusual fluctuations (e.g., budget overspending, sudden drop in conversions). This helps identify issues promptly and take corrective action. Weekly In-Depth Analysis: Conduct a more detailed analysis weekly, reviewing the performance of keywords, ad groups, ad copy, and search term reports. This is the best frequency for identifying optimization opportunities and making adjustments (e.g., adding negative keywords, testing new ads, adjusting bids). Monthly/Quarterly Strategic Review: Conduct a macroscopic review monthly or quarterly to evaluate overall ROI, the effectiveness of different campaigns, whether budget allocation is reasonable, and adjust long-term strategies in conjunction with business goals. This is a good time to prepare comprehensive reports for management or clients.

Data discrepancies are common and usually result from different data collection and processing mechanisms. Here are some common reasons and troubleshooting methods: Different Attribution Models: Google Ads defaults to a “last click” attribution model (unless you modify it), while Google Analytics typically uses a “data-driven” or “last non-direct click” attribution model. Different attribution models lead to differences in conversion counting. Data Latency: Google Ads data usually updates faster, while Google Analytics data may have a few hours of delay. Time Zone Settings: Ensure that the time zone settings are consistent across your Google Ads account and Google Analytics property. Conversion Counting Methods: Google Ads can record multiple conversions for the same user within a day, while Google Analytics by default only records one per session. Check if the conversion event definitions are exactly the same on both platforms. Tracking Code Issues: Ensure your website has Google Ads conversion tracking code and Google Analytics (GA4) code installed correctly, without duplication or errors. Check for code conflicts. Cross-Device/Cross-Domain Tracking: If users convert on different devices, or jump across subdomains/different domains, improper tracking setup can lead to data loss. Troubleshooting Steps: Check time zone and attribution model settings. Verify conversion event definitions and code installation. Use tools like Google Tag Assistant for debugging. Compare small data sets. Choose data from one day or one week for detailed comparison, rather than long-term accumulated data, as this makes issues easier to spot.

When explaining SEM reports to non-marketers (such as management or clients), the key is to be concise, intuitive, and focused on business outcomes and recommendations, rather than marketing jargon. Focus on Business Goals: Start the report by directly stating, “What is our goal? What is the current progress?” (e.g., “Sales increased by X% this month, and lead acquisition cost decreased by Y%”). Use Easy-to-Understand Language: Avoid acronyms like “CPC,” “CPA,” “ROAS.” If you must use them, explain them clearly. For example, say “cost to acquire a customer” instead of “CPA.” Highlight Key Metrics: Only present 3-5 core metrics most directly related to business outcomes, such as conversion volume, total cost, and return on investment. Avoid cluttering with too many details. Visual Presentation: Use charts and graphs to show trends and comparisons, rather than just numerical tables. For example, use a trend chart to show sales growth, and a pie chart to show the contribution of different product lines. Google Looker Studio is an excellent tool for creating clear, automated reports. Provide Insights and Recommendations: Most importantly, don’t just present data; explain what the data means and, based on these insights, what you will do next.

Imagine you’re in a bustling digital marketplace, eager to sell your products or services. Customers are looking for specific items, and both you and your competitors want to display your offerings in the most prominent spots. In this market, whoever gets seen first captures the opportunity. In the world of Search Engine Marketing (SEM), this process of “contesting for prominent positions” is called SEM Bidding. Simply put, SEM bidding refers to the process where advertisers set bids for specific keywords on search engine advertising platforms (like Google Ads, Microsoft Ads) to compete for ad display positions and clicks. Your bid, along with other factors like ad quality, collectively determines whether your ad appears at the top when a user searches, or if it doesn’t appear at all. Bidding is the core driving force of SEM; it dictates whether your ads can reach potential customers.

Both aim to gain visibility on search engines, but their methods are distinctly different: Feature Dimension SEM Bidding (Paid Search/PPC) SEO (Organic Search) Visibility Source Paid advertising: Purchasing ad space through bidding; ads usually carry “Ad” or “Sponsored” labels Organic ranking: Gaining rankings for free by optimizing website content, structure, and authority Speed to Results Immediate: Ads can display instantly after campaign setup and approval Long-term: Takes weeks, months, or even longer to see ranking effects Cost Model Pay-Per-Click (PPC): Pay each time a user clicks on the ad; costs are controllable Free: But requires investment in labor, time, content creation, and technical optimization costs Control Level High: Precise control over ad copy, bids, target audience, and ad scheduling Low: Ranking algorithms are controlled by search engines; rankings cannot be directly purchased Ad Position Typically in top, bottom, or side ad slots on the search results page Usually below ad slots on the search results page, i.e., in the organic search results area In simple terms, SEM bidding is like renting a high-traffic booth for a one-time event—it’s quick but requires continuous payment. SEO, on the other hand, is more like investing in building your own long-term, high-quality physical store—it’s slower to show results, but once established, it brings continuous free customer traffic. The two are not mutually exclusive; they can complement each other to enhance your influence on search engines.

SEM bidding is not just about placing a bid; it directly relates to your ad performance and whether your overall marketing goals can be achieved. Its importance is reflected in the following aspects: Determines Ad Rank and Visibility: On the Search Engine Results Page (SERP), position is everything. Users typically only pay attention to the top-ranking ads. Your bidding strategy directly influences whether your ad appears in these prime positions, where potential customers can see it. Bidding too low might leave your ad unnoticed; bidding too high could waste your budget. Effectively Controls Advertising Costs: The core of SEM bidding is to get as many effective clicks and conversions as possible at the lowest possible cost. A shrewd bidding strategy can help you balance bids with your budget, reducing your Cost Per Click (CPC), thereby generating a higher Return On Investment (ROI) for your advertising spend. Blindly bidding too high or too low can lead to inefficiency. Achieves Specific Marketing Objectives: Different marketing objectives require different bidding strategies. Is it to maximize brand exposure for more clicks? To acquire potential customers by optimizing for conversions? Or to maximize sales revenue by focusing on conversion value? The selection and adjustment of bidding strategies are core methods for achieving these specific marketing objectives. It makes your ad campaigns more purposeful and efficient. Responds to Market Competition: Your competitors are also actively participating in SEM bidding. Their bids, ad quality, and strategies will directly affect your ad rank and costs. A flexible and data-driven bidding strategy can help you maintain an advantage in fierce market competition, and even find unique breakthroughs. In summary, SEM bidding is a critical link in digital marketing that connects advertising investment with business results. A deep understanding and optimization of bidding strategies are essential for every marketer.

This isn’t just about how high your bid is; it’s determined by two key factors: Ad Rank and Quality Score. They are at the heart of the Google Ads auction mechanism, and understanding them is crucial for optimizing your ad performance. ","date":"2025-09-12","objectID":"/posts/sem-bidding/:2:0","tags":["SEM","Digital Marketing","Google Ads"],"title":"The Ultimate Guide to SEM Bidding Strategies","uri":"/posts/sem-bidding/"},{"categories":["SEM","Digital Marketing"],"content":"Ad Rank: The Determinant of Your Ad’s Position Ad Rank is a comprehensive metric that determines your ad’s position on the search results page and whether your ad will be shown at all. The higher your Ad Rank, the higher your ad will appear, increasing your chances of getting more impressions and clicks. The Google Ads Ad Rank calculation formula is as follows: $$\\text{Ad Rank} = \\text{Bid} \\times \\text{Quality Score} + \\text{Impact of Ad Extensions and Other Formats}$$ Let’s break down this formula: Bid: This is the maximum amount you’re willing to pay for each click. While a higher bid increases your Ad Rank, it’s not the only determining factor. Quality Score: This is Google’s measure of the relevance and quality of your ads, keywords, and landing page. It has a significant impact on Ad Rank, and we’ll discuss it in detail in the next section. Impact of Ad Extensions and Other Formats: Ad extensions (such as sitelinks, structured snippets, callouts, etc.) can provide more useful information for your ad, taking up more space and thus improving user experience and click-through rates. If an ad includes these extensions and they are expected to improve ad performance, Google will positively consider them in the Ad Rank calculation. The significance of Ad Rank is that you don’t always need to bid the highest to get the best position. An ad with a higher Quality Score, even if its bid is slightly lower than a competitor’s, may achieve a better ad rank and even win the auction at a lower Cost Per Click (CPC). This is because Google wants to provide users with the most relevant and helpful ads, thereby enhancing the overall search experience.

It’s scored on a scale of 1 to 10, with a higher score indicating that Google deems your ad more relevant and useful. Quality Score is the “invisible lever” of the bidding mechanism. It has a profound impact on your ad performance and costs: Impacts Ad Rank: As mentioned above, a higher Quality Score directly increases your Ad Rank, giving you a competitive advantage in the auction. Lowers Cost Per Click (CPC): Ads with a high Quality Score can usually win better ad positions at a lower CPC. This means you can get more clicks for the same budget, significantly improving ad efficiency. Improves Ad Eligibility: Ads with a Quality Score that is too low may not even be eligible to be shown. So, what factors specifically influence Quality Score? Google Ads primarily considers these three points: 1. Expected Click-Through Rate (Expected CTR) Definition: Google’s prediction of the likelihood that your ad will be clicked when shown. This is primarily based on your ad’s historical performance. Optimization Method: Write eye-catching ad copy that is highly relevant to the user’s search intent, and use ad extensions to provide more information and value, enhancing the ad’s appeal. For more tips on writing high-CTR ad copy, please refer to “Key Techniques for Writing High-Converting SEM Copy”. 2. Ad Relevance Definition: The degree of relevance between your keywords and your ad copy (including headline, description). Google evaluates whether your ad content accurately responds to the user’s search query. Optimization Method: Ensure your ad copy directly includes or is closely associated with your targeted keywords. Create highly customized ad groups and ads for different keyword groups to improve relevance. For a deeper understanding of keyword selection and targeting, read “Keyword Research and Targeting in the AI Era”. 3. Landing Page Experience Definition: The quality, relevance, transparency, and usability of the landing page that users reach after clicking your ad. Google evaluates whether the landing page provides clear, valuable information consistent with the ad content. Optimization Method: Relevance: Ensure the landing page content highly matches the ad copy and keywords, fulfilling the promises made in the ad. Usability: The page design should be clean and clear, with a logical information structure, making it easy to navigate and find key information. Transparency: Provide clear product/service information, contact details, and privacy policies. Load Speed: Ensure the landing page loads quickly, especially on mobile devices. Slow load speeds can severely damage user experience.

Choosing a bidding strategy is not a one-time decision; it’s a dynamic process that requires adjustment based on data. Here are several key considerations: 1. Define Marketing Objectives Goals First: This is the most important step. Do you want to increase website traffic, boost brand awareness, acquire more leads, or directly drive sales? Different objectives correspond to different bidding strategies. Clicks \u003e Conversions: Consider “Maximize Clicks.” Conversions \u003e Conversion Value: Consider “Maximize Conversions” or “Target CPA.” Conversion Value \u003e Conversions: Consider “Maximize Conversion Value” or “Target ROAS.” Brand Exposure/Position \u003e Other: Consider “Target Impression Share.” 2. Consider Account Historical Data and Conversion Tracking Data is Foundation: Smart Bidding strategies require sufficient and accurate conversion data to learn and optimize. If your account is brand new, or has very few monthly conversions (e.g., less than 30 conversions/month), Smart Bidding may struggle to operate effectively. Conversion Tracking: Ensure your conversion tracking is set up correctly and the data is reliable, otherwise Smart Bidding will optimize based on erroneous information. For e-commerce, tracking with conversion values needs to be set up. 3. Budget and Risk Tolerance Budget Size: Smart Bidding generally performs better with a relatively ample budget, as it needs a certain amount of traffic and data to “learn.” Risk Assessment: Smart Bidding may fluctuate during its initial learning phase, requiring time for it to adapt. If your budget is very tight, or you have low tolerance for short-term fluctuations in conversion costs, you might need to start with manual bidding or more conservative Smart Bidding strategies. 4. Industry Characteristics and Competitive Landscape Industry Averages: Understanding average CPAs, ROAS, and other metrics in your industry helps set more realistic goals. Competitive Intensity: In highly competitive industries, Smart Bidding can help you stand out better in auctions because it can adjust bids in real-time. 5. Flexible Application, Dynamic Adjustment No One-Size-Fits-All: Market conditions, user behavior, and your business goals are constantly changing. Therefore, bidding strategies also need regular review and adjustment. Experiment and Test: Don’t be afraid to try different Smart Bidding strategies and use A/B testing to compare their effectiveness.

Keyword Selection and Match Types: The Foundation of Traffic Quality Keywords are the bridge connecting users with your products/services. Precise keyword selection and appropriate match types are fundamental to ensuring your ads are seen by the right audience and drive high-quality traffic. Keyword Precision: Choosing keywords that are highly relevant to your product or service and reflect clear user search intent is crucial. For example, an ad selling “men’s athletic shoes” might attract a lot of irrelevant traffic if it only uses a broad term like “shoes.” For detailed keyword research methods, please refer to “Keyword Research and Targeting in the AI Era”. Match Types: Google Ads offers various keyword match types to control which search queries can trigger your ads: Broad Match: The widest reach, can trigger searches related to the keyword, misspellings, synonyms, or related concepts. It generates high traffic but may not be precise, requiring the use of negative keywords. Phrase Match: Ads will show for searches that include your exact phrase or its close variations. Offers more control than broad match but still provides some flexibility. Exact Match: Ads will only show when a user searches for your exact keyword or its close variations. Generates the least traffic but is the most precise, usually yielding the highest conversion rates. Proper use of match types helps you balance traffic coverage and precision, thereby optimizing bidding effectiveness. Negative Keywords: Exclude search terms irrelevant to your product or service. For example, if you sell new items, you can add negative keywords like “used” or “free.” This effectively prevents your ads from appearing in irrelevant searches, reduces unnecessary click waste, and thus improves ad relevance and Quality Score.

If the ad says “Free trial of XYZ software,” the landing page should immediately display a free trial form and relevant information, not a company introduction page. Inconsistencies lead to user confusion and high bounce rates. Clear Value Proposition and Call to Action (CTA): The landing page needs to clearly tell users what value your product or service can bring them and guide them to complete a clear conversion action. The CTA button should be prominent, and the copy clear. Excellent User Experience: Load Speed: The faster the page loads, the better. Slow pages will quickly lose users and lower Google’s rating of landing page quality. Mobile-Friendly: Ensure the landing page displays and functions well on various devices, including mobile phones and tablets.

The effectiveness of Smart Bidding highly depends on conversion data. If data is insufficient, you can try the following methods: Choose Broader Conversion Goals: If high-value conversions (like purchases) are too few, you can start by tracking “micro-conversions,” such as: Watching a video Downloading a brochure Signing up for a newsletter Visiting a specific page for more than a certain duration These micro-conversions can provide AI with more learning signals, even if they aren’t the ultimate goal. Extend the Learning Period: Give Smart Bidding more time and budget to accumulate data. During the learning period, avoid frequent changes to settings. Use “Maximize Clicks” as a Starting Point: Run a “Maximize Clicks” strategy for a while to acquire enough traffic and ensure conversion tracking accurately records all conversions, laying the groundwork for subsequent Smart Bidding strategies. Provide Audience Signals: In campaigns like Performance Max, providing detailed audience signals (e.g., custom audiences, remarketing lists) can help AI identify your target customers faster, even with less conversion data. Integrate Offline Conversion Data: If your business involves offline conversions, uploading this data to Google Ads can provide AI with a more comprehensive basis for optimization.

Yes, they are, but their function is different. In manual bidding: Bid adjustments are direct tools for advertisers to precisely control bids. For example, increasing bids by 20% for mobile devices means your manual bid will directly increase by 20%. In Smart Bidding: Smart Bidding already leverages AI to automatically consider signals like device, geographic location, time, and audience to optimize bids. Therefore, the bid adjustments you set will not directly modify the AI’s bids but rather serve as guidance signals. You can set bid adjustments to express your preference or importance for a certain dimension (e.g., a specific device or audience). The AI will incorporate these preferences into its learning model and attempt to optimize for your primary conversion goal while considering these preferences. For example, if you know that mobile users have a higher conversion value, but the Smart Bidding optimization results aren’t as expected, you can try increasing the bid adjustment for mobile devices to “tell” the AI about this preference. When using Smart Bidding, it’s generally recommended to let the AI learn freely for a period. If you observe that performance in specific dimensions is not ideal, then try fine-tuning with bid adjustments.

The learning period refers to the time a Smart Bidding strategy needs to collect data, analyze user behavior, and adjust its bidding model after being launched or undergoing significant changes. During this period, you might observe: Data Fluctuations: Metrics like conversion volume, CPA, or ROAS might show significant fluctuations, and performance might not meet expectations. Bid Changes: The system will experiment with different bids to find the optimal optimization path. Duration of the Learning Period: It typically ranges from a few days to several weeks, depending on your campaign type, budget, and conversion volume. Google Ads generally recommends 5-7 days, and for Performance Max, it might take longer (e.g., 2-4 weeks) to fully learn. Avoid Frequent Changes: During the learning period, you should try to avoid frequently changing your bidding strategy, budget, ad group settings, or conversion goals. Every significant change can potentially trigger a new learning period. Be Patient: Giving Smart Bidding enough time to learn is crucial. Premature intervention or switching strategies might hinder the AI from achieving optimal optimization results.

Imagine this: your website’s homepage is like the cover of a magazine, featuring a table of contents and previews of various articles, giving readers a comprehensive overview of your brand and all its offerings. A landing page, however, is more like a specific advertisement page within that magazine—it focuses on one thing: promoting a particular product or service and encouraging immediate action from the reader. Feature Dimension Landing Page Regular Website Page (e.g., Homepage/Product Page) Primary Goal Single and clear: Conversion (registration, purchase, download, etc.) Diverse: Provide information, brand building, user navigation, content exploration, etc. Navigation Usually minimal or absent: Reduces user distraction, focuses on conversion Rich and comprehensive: Helps users explore various parts of the website Content Highly focused: Detailed explanation around a specific product, service, or offer Broad or multi-faceted: Introduces the brand, showcases all products/services, publishes blog posts, etc. URL Source Typically drives traffic from paid ads (PPC), email marketing, social media ads, etc. Primarily gains traffic through organic search, direct access, internal links, etc. ","date":"2025-09-11","objectID":"/posts/landing-page-optimization/:1:1","tags":["SEM","Digital Marketing","Google Ads"],"title":"The Ultimate Guide to Landing Page Optimization","uri":"/posts/landing-page-optimization/"},{"categories":["SEM","Digital Marketing"],"content":"Why Some Ads Use the Official Website Directly, While Others Use Standalone Landing Pages? This is a very common question and an important consideration in advertising strategy. The choice between using a standalone landing page or directly linking to an official website page primarily depends on your marketing objectives, budget, and user experience expectations: Standalone Landing Page Characteristics: Typically lacks top navigation bars, footer links, or any elements that might distract users. The content is concise, with only one primary CTA. Advantages: Maximize Conversion: By eliminating distractions, it forces users to focus only on the core message and conversion button, thereby maximizing a single conversion goal. Highly Customizable: Can be highly personalized in design and content creation for specific ad copy, keywords, and audience segments. Easier for A/B Testing: Its independence allows for quick iteration and testing of different versions to validate the impact of various elements on conversions. Eliminates Psychological Discrepancy: Precisely matches ad copy, preventing users from feeling “misled” after clicking through. Applicable Scenarios: Specific marketing campaigns, new product launches, short-term promotions, needing to quickly test different ad creative effects, and situations with sufficient budget aiming for high conversions. For example, an ad for “free software trial” would typically lead to a standalone landing page with only a trial registration form. Website Page as Landing Page Characteristics: Directly uses an existing page on your official website (such as a product detail page, service introduction page, or blog post) as the target page after an ad click. Advantages: Leverage Brand Trust: Official website pages usually have full brand identity and navigation, providing richer brand information and trustworthiness. Information Richness: For products/services that require users to understand more details or make multi-dimensional comparisons, an official website page can offer more comprehensive content. Lower Cost: No need for additional development of independent pages; directly utilizes existing resources. Disadvantages: Distraction: Navigation, other links, and excessive information on the page might distract users from the core CTA, diluting conversions. Limited Personalization: More difficult to deeply customize for each ad campaign. Applicable Scenarios: Brands with high recognition, complex product lines (where users might need to browse other related products), limited budget, or situations where you want users to browse more related information before converting. For example, an ad for “buy the latest smartphone” might directly lead to the product detail page on the official website. The choice ultimately depends on your specific marketing goals, budget, target audience’s purchase stage, and your expectations for user experience.

A landing page isn’t just a page; it’s your digital marketing campaign’s “conversion hub,” acting as a bridge between user intent and business outcomes. It’s Key to Achieving ROI: You invest significant time and money in keyword research, writing high-quality ad copy, and optimizing paid search campaigns. The ultimate goal of all these efforts is for users to convert on the landing page. An optimized landing page can convert the same traffic into more sales or leads, directly boosting your return on investment (ROI). Directly Impacts Ad Performance and Cost: For instance, with Google Ads, the landing page experience is a critical component of your Quality Score. If your landing page is irrelevant to your ad copy, loads slowly, or offers a poor user experience, your Quality Score will decrease. This not only affects your ad’s display position but also leads to an increase in Cost Per Click (CPC). Conversely, an excellent landing page can help you achieve better ad rankings at a lower cost. Provides Valuable Insights and Data: Landing page data (such as conversion rates, bounce rates, time on page, user behavior flow) is a valuable source for continuous ad campaign optimization and understanding user behavior. Through this data, you can constantly adjust and improve your marketing strategy. Therefore, optimizing your landing page is not optional; it’s one of the core elements that determine the success or failure of your digital marketing efforts.

Clear and Compelling Headline The headline is the first thing users see on your landing page and is crucial for deciding whether they continue reading. A good headline must quickly grab user attention and clearly convey your core value proposition. High Ad-to-Landing Page Congruence: Users click on your ad with an expectation based on a specific promise in the ad. If the landing page’s headline doesn’t immediately address that promise, users will feel confused, even misled, leading to a high bounce rate. For example, if the ad says “Get Free SEO Optimization Guide,” the landing page headline should be “Get Your Free: 2025 Latest SEO Optimization Guide,” not “Welcome to Our Marketing Company.” Highlight a Single, Quantifiable Unique Value Proposition (UVP): Clearly tell users what problem you can solve for them or what unique benefit you offer. Try to quantify these benefits, such as “Save 2 hours a day” or “Increase conversion rates by 30%.” Use Strong Verbs and User-Oriented Language: The wording should be active, engaging, and focused on what the user will gain. Avoid industry jargon or vague adjectives. Your headline should act like a powerful magnet, firmly holding the user’s attention and making them feel, “This is exactly what I’m looking for!” ","date":"2025-09-11","objectID":"/posts/landing-page-optimization/:2:1","tags":["SEM","Digital Marketing","Google Ads"],"title":"The Ultimate Guide to Landing Page Optimization","uri":"/posts/landing-page-optimization/"},{"categories":["SEM","Digital Marketing"],"content":"2. Clear and Unique Call to Action (CTA) The CTA is one of the most important elements on a landing page; it clearly tells users what you want them to do next. A landing page without a clear CTA is like a crossroads without a signpost—users will get lost. Clear, Specific, and Action-Oriented Text: The text on the CTA button must be intuitive. For example, “Start Free Trial Now,” “Get a Quote,” “Download Whitepaper,” or “Buy Now” are more effective than “Submit” or “Learn More.” Visually Striking Button Design, Strong Color Contrast, Easy to Click: The CTA button should visually contrast sharply with other page elements to attract user attention. The button should also be large enough to be easily clickable on all devices, especially mobile. Placement Strategy: The CTA button should ideally be above the fold so users can see it without scrolling. You can also repeat the CTA further down the page, but the above-the-fold CTA is crucial. Reduce Friction in the Action Path: If your CTA is “Register,” then the subsequent form should be as simple as possible. Asking for too much information increases the user’s psychological burden, leading to lost conversions. Ideally, a landing page should have only one primary CTA to avoid overwhelming users with choices. If you need to offer multiple action options, ensure one is the most prominent and important.

Compelling Copy The headline and CTA grab user attention and point the way, while the copy is central to persuading users to take action. It needs to elaborate on value, address user pain points, and build trust. Focus on User Benefits, Not Product Features: Users care more about what your product or service can do for them, rather than just its features. Instead of saying, “Our software has 100 integrations,” say, “Our software seamlessly connects with your existing tools, eliminating data migration headaches.” Use Clear, Concise Language; Avoid Jargon or Vague Descriptions: Communicate in language users understand. If a concept is complex, try explaining it with simple examples or analogies. Use Subheadings, Bullet Points, and Bold Text to Improve Readability: Users often “scan” landing pages rather than “read” them carefully. A clear structure helps them quickly find key information. Build Emotional Connection and Evoke Empathy: Describe the pain points users might face, then show how your solution perfectly addresses their needs, perhaps even exceeding expectations. Good copy is like an excellent salesperson: it understands the customer’s needs and can present the product’s value in the most effective way.

High-Quality Visuals The adage “a picture is worth a thousand words” rings true on a landing page. High-quality images and videos can quickly convey information, enhance appeal, and strengthen brand image. Images and videos should be highly relevant to the product/service and professionally produced: Blurry, low-resolution, or irrelevant images will harm your professional image and reduce user trust. Showcase product usage scenarios or problem-solving effects through images/demos: Let users visually see how the product works or what specific changes the service can bring. For example, a time management tool can display its minimalist interface and an animation of automatic calendar syncing. Optimize image loading speed and format to avoid impacting page performance: Even the most exquisite images will cause users to lose patience if they load slowly. Using modern image formats (like WebP) and compressing image sizes are key to improving speed. Visual elements are not just decoration; they are crucial carriers of information and emotional communication.

Social Proof for Building Trust In today’s information-saturated age, user trust in advertising is generally low. Social proof is an effective way to alleviate user doubts and boost their confidence in making a decision. It leverages the psychological tendency of people to follow the actions of the majority. Customer Testimonials, Reviews, Case Studies: These are the most direct and effective forms of social proof. Displaying real customer names, photos, company names, or even video testimonials can significantly increase credibility. Authority Certifications, Partner Logos: If your product or service has received industry certifications or partnered with well-known brands, displaying these logos can enhance professionalism and trust. Highlight Quantifiable Data such as User Count, Download Volume, Media Mentions: Data like “Trusted by 100k+ users,” “App downloads exceed a million,” or “Featured in Forbes” can effectively boost brand influence. Don’t be afraid to show positive reviews alongside any negative ones; this can actually increase authenticity.

Streamlined Forms If your landing page’s goal is to collect lead information, then the form is the gateway to conversion. The more complex the form, the lower the completion rate. Only ask for necessary information; fewer fields lead to higher completion rates: Every additional question asked increases the user’s abandonment rate. Collect only the information absolutely essential for your current business process. For example, if you’re just offering a free trial, you might only need an email address and password. Clearly state the form’s purpose and privacy policy: Tell users why you need this information and how you will protect their privacy. For complex information gathering, consider using a multi-step form: Breaking a long form into several smaller steps can reduce initial psychological pressure on users and increase completion rates. For example, the first step might only ask for name and email, and the second step for company and position. Each field you remove from a form can lead to a significant increase in conversion rates.

Mobile-Friendly Design As mobile devices become the primary means of internet access, your landing page’s performance on mobile phones directly impacts the experience and conversion of most users. Adopt responsive design that automatically adapts to different screen sizes: Ensure your landing page automatically adjusts layout and element sizes, whether on a phone, tablet, or desktop computer, to provide the optimal viewing experience. Ensure touch-friendly buttons and forms, easy to operate on small screens: Buttons and input fields should be large enough and spaced appropriately to prevent accidental taps. Optimize content layout to avoid excessively long scrolling or zooming on mobile phones: Keep content concise, paragraphs should not be too long, and images and videos should adapt to mobile screens.

Page Load Speed No one likes to wait. Slow page load speed is a primary cause of high user bounce rates. It not only affects user experience but also negatively impacts your ad performance. Compress images, videos, and code files to reduce file size: This is the most direct and effective way to speed things up. Use appropriate image formats (like WebP) and efficient compression tools. Utilize browser caching and lazy loading: Browser caching can store content that users have previously visited, so it doesn’t need to be re-downloaded on subsequent visits. Lazy loading allows non-above-the-fold content to load only when the user scrolls into view, improving initial load speed. Reduce unnecessary JavaScript and CSS: Streamline code, remove unused styles and scripts. Use a CDN (Content Delivery Network) to accelerate content delivery: A CDN distributes your content to servers around the globe, allowing users to retrieve content from the server closest to them, thereby speeding up load times. Regularly use tools like Google PageSpeed Insights or GTmetrix to check your landing page load speed and optimize according to their recommendations. Remember, every second slower can drop your conversion rate by several percentage points, while also affecting your Ad Quality Score and increasing your Cost Per Click (CPC).

Personalized Content and Recommendations AI’s power lies in its personalization capabilities, allowing every user who visits a landing page to receive a “tailored” experience: Dynamic Content Replacement: Based on the user’s source channel, historical browsing behavior, or even real-time geographic location, AI can dynamically adjust product recommendations, case studies, or user reviews on the landing page. For example, if a user clicks from a blog post about “e-commerce operations,” the landing page can automatically prioritize showcasing success stories from the e-commerce industry.

Predictive Analytics and Optimization Suggestions AI doesn’t just analyze the past; it excels at predicting the future: Predict Conversion Potential: AI models can analyze existing data to predict which page elements, copy combinations, or user paths are more likely to lead to conversions. This allows marketers to focus their efforts on the most promising optimization points. Automated Identification of “Semantic Drift Points”: AI can analyze user behavior on the landing page and, combined with their search intent, automatically identify areas where users might feel confused, where information might be mismatched, or where “semantic drift” occurs, providing specific optimization suggestions. For example, if many users leave after a particular paragraph, AI might suggest revising the wording of that paragraph or adding supplementary information.

Impact of Google Search Generative Experience (SGE) on Landing Pages With the increasing prevalence of Google Search Generative Experience (SGE), which provides AI-powered generative search experiences, users can get richer, more direct answers and summaries on the search results page even before clicking on ads or search results. This presents new challenges and opportunities for landing page optimization: Increased Pressure for “Content Delivery”: If users have already obtained some answers in the search results, the landing page’s primary task will no longer just be to provide information, but to deliver on the promise more quickly, deeply, and persuasively. The landing page must excel in its headline, value proposition, and the smoothness of its conversion flow to further drive users to convert. Simply repeating information already available in SGE will no longer be effective. Highlighting Unique Value: Landing pages need to emphasize your unique selling points and competitive advantages even more, as users may already have a basic understanding of the information. You must provide added value beyond AI summaries, such as exclusive offers, in-depth case studies, personalized services, more attractive visual content, or emotional connections. Stronger Interactivity and Trust Building: Future landing pages may require stronger interactive elements (e.g., calculators, configuration tools), more direct trust endorsements (e.g., user reviews, authoritative certifications), and more personalized user experiences, to further impress users and drive conversions, even when their information needs have been partially met. Data-Driven Continuous Optimization: In an AI-driven search environment, landing page optimization will rely even more on real-time data feedback and AI tool assistance to quickly adapt to changes in user behavior. Understanding changes in user search behavior within the SGE environment is key to optimizing landing pages.

How do I measure landing page success? Landing page conversion rates vary significantly depending on the industry, product, target audience, and marketing campaign, so there’s no single “standard” average. General Range: Generally, good conversion rates for most industries are considered to be between 2% and 5%. However, some exceptionally performing landing pages can reach 10%, 20%, or even higher, while poorly designed ones might be well below 1%. Influencing Factors: Industry and Product: High-value, high-commitment products (like enterprise software demos) might have lower conversion rates, while free downloads or trial registrations could have higher rates. Traffic Quality: Traffic from highly targeted paid search keywords typically converts better than generic social media traffic. Page Design and Copy: A clear value proposition, strong CTA, and good user experience are all critical. Market Competition: A highly competitive market might require an even better landing page to stand out. Measuring landing page success isn’t just about conversion rate; you also need to consider the following metrics: Conversion Rate: The percentage of visitors who complete the desired goal. This is the most important metric. Cost Per Acquisition (CPA): The average advertising cost to acquire one conversion. Bounce Rate: The percentage of users who leave the landing page without interacting further. A high bounce rate often indicates that the page content doesn’t match user expectations or that the user experience is poor. Time on Page: The average amount of time users spend on the landing page. Longer time on page might indicate user interest (but also needs to be judged in conjunction with other metrics). User Flow: User behavior data on the landing page, such as scroll depth and click areas, which can be analyzed with heatmaps and session recording tools. Return On Ad Spend (ROAS): The ratio of advertising spend to the sales revenue generated, a key metric for measuring marketing campaign profitability.

As a rule, a high-converting landing page should strive for only one primary CTA to avoid user choice paralysis (Paradox of Choice). Why “One” is Ideal: The core goal of a landing page is a single conversion. Too many CTAs can distract users, leaving them unsure what to do, which actually lowers the overall conversion rate. You want users to take “the action you most want them to take.” Exceptions (Secondary CTAs): In some cases, you might consider including a secondary CTA, but it must: Be at a different stage of the user journey than the primary CTA: For example, the primary CTA is “Start Free Trial,” while the secondary CTA might be “Watch Demo Video” or “Download Whitepaper.” Secondary CTAs usually aim to provide more information to users who aren’t ready to convert yet, helping them learn more. Be visually less prominent than the primary CTA: Its color, size, and placement should be less conspicuous, ensuring it doesn’t steal attention from the primary CTA. Typically be placed lower on the page: After reading more content, if users still have doubts, the secondary CTA can offer a soft conversion opportunity.

This depends on your brand strategy, SEO considerations, and ease of management. Both have pros and cons: Under Your Main Website Domain (Subdomain or Subdirectory): Examples: landing.yourcompany.com (subdomain) or www.yourcompany.com/landing-page (subdirectory) Pros: SEO Benefits: Can inherit some of the main domain’s authority and trust, which can benefit the landing page’s organic search performance (if SEO is desired). Brand Consistency: Maintains the same brand image, navigation (if retained), and URL structure as the main site. Easier Management: Usually uses the same CMS and analytics tools as the main site. Cons: Potential Distraction: If main site navigation is kept, it might distract users. Deployment Limitations: May be subject to the main site’s technical architecture limitations. Recommended Scenarios: High brand recognition, need to integrate the landing page as part of website content, or aim to boost main site SEO value through the landing page. Separate Domain: Examples: yourproductoffer.com or getyourfreesoftware.com Pros: Complete Independence: Brand and content can be entirely independent of the main site, ideal for short-term marketing campaigns or testing new brands. No Distraction: Allows for the complete removal of all unnecessary navigation elements, achieving extreme conversion focus. Technical Flexibility: Can use any website builder or technology, free from main site restrictions. Cons: SEO Disadvantages: Needs to build domain authority and trust from scratch. Brand Fragmentation: If users are unfamiliar with your brand, it might cause confusion or lack of trust. Management Costs: Requires additional domain and hosting management.

Not necessarily; it depends on your landing page’s traffic sources and marketing goals. If the primary traffic to your landing page comes from paid advertising (PPC), email marketing, social media ads, etc.: Traditional SEO optimization is usually not required. The reason is that this traffic is “bought” or “pushed,” and users arrive directly at the page by clicking an ad, rather than discovering it through search engines. The landing page should focus more on Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) rather than keyword rankings. However, page load speed, mobile-friendliness, and content relevance are still very important because these factors affect Google Ads Quality Score, which in turn impacts ad costs and effectiveness. These factors overlap somewhat with technical SEO optimization. If the landing page also aims to acquire traffic through organic search: Then SEO optimization is necessary. This might be for long-term product description pages, content marketing landing pages, or specific pages designed to attract organic traffic. In this case, you’ll need to consider traditional SEO strategies such as keyword research, on-page content optimization, meta tags, internal linking, and external link building.

The “Ad-to-Landing Page Congruence” is crucial for high conversion rates and is an important metric Google uses to evaluate ad quality. Inconsistencies lead to poor user experience, high bounce rates, and a decrease in Ad Quality Score. Ensure Information Match: Keyword Match: Keywords used in the ad should be repeated in the landing page headline and content. Value Proposition Match: The unique selling points or offers promised in the ad must be clearly presented and delivered on the landing page. For example, if the ad says “Limited Time 50% Off,” the landing page must prominently display the 50% off information. Tone and Style Match: The tone of the ad (formal, lively, professional) should be consistent with the landing page copy. Use Dynamic Text Replacement (DTR): For PPC ads, you can leverage DTR features in ad platforms to dynamically insert the user’s search query into the landing page’s headline or content. This maximizes relevance and makes the user feel the page is custom-tailored for them. Create Specific Landing Pages for Each Ad Group: If you have multiple ad groups, each potentially targeting different keywords or user intents, then it’s best to create separate landing page versions for each ad group or for highly relevant ad groups. While this increases workload, the boost in conversion rates usually compensates for it. Continuous Monitoring and A/B Testing: Monitor ad campaign data and landing page performance using tools like Google Analytics. If an ad group’s landing page shows a high bounce rate or low conversion rate, it’s likely a signal of copy inconsistency. Regularly check the match between ads and landing pages using the analysis methods from “The Complete Guide to SEM Data Analysis”.

When a user types a keyword into a search engine, your ad appears in a prominent position on the search results page. You only pay when a user clicks on your ad. In our Ultimate Guide to Paid Search Advertising (PPC) article, we’ll discuss in detail how to set up your first ad campaign. Display Advertising: These ads do not appear on search results pages, but rather in the form of images, videos, or text, on websites related to your products or services, expanding brand exposure. What’s the Difference Between SEM, PPC, and Display Ads? Many people often use these three terms interchangeably, but they are actually in a relationship of inclusion and being included. SEM is an umbrella term. It covers all activities that increase visibility on search engines through paid methods. PPC is a billing model, meaning “pay-per-click.” Paid search and display advertising are two types of ad types. The most common point of confusion is PPC. While it literally refers to a billing method, in daily communication, people often use PPC to specifically refer to paid search advertising.

When you search on search engines like Google or Bing, distinguishing between SEM ads and SEO organic results is actually very simple. Look for the following key indicators: “Ad” or “Sponsored” Label: SEM Ads: The most obvious feature is that the result will have a clear “Ad”, “Sponsored”, or similar label next to it. These labels are usually located to the left or right of the title, and their color and font may differ slightly from regular text, but they are always clearly visible. Search engines set these labels to inform users that the result is a paid promotion. SEO Organic Results: In contrast, organic search results obtained through SEO optimization will not have any “Ad” labels. These are pages that search engines consider most relevant and valuable to the user’s query based on their algorithms. Placement: SEM Ads: Typically appear at the top (uppermost) and bottom (lowermost) of the search results page. In some cases, they may also appear in the right sidebar. These are prime paid positions. SEO Organic Results: Located below the ad results, usually in the middle section of the page. These rankings are naturally sorted by the algorithm, not obtained through payment. URL Display: While not as direct as the “Ad” label, sometimes ad URLs may contain tracking parameters that differ slightly from the concise URLs of organic results. However, the “Ad” label remains the most reliable way to distinguish between the two.

A mature digital marketing strategy often employs both methods simultaneously. Here are some examples of how they can work together: Data Sharing, Strategy Optimization: SEM Helps SEO: You can quickly test the conversion effectiveness and user intent of different keywords through keyword research. Keywords that perform well in SEM are often also worth investing SEO resources to optimize their organic ranking content. At the same time, the performance of SEM’s ad copy and creatives can also provide inspiration for SEO’s title tags and meta descriptions. SEO Helps SEM: A website with a good SEO foundation (e.g., fast website loading speed, friendly user experience) can usually also achieve a higher ad quality score in SEM. A higher quality score means you may get better ad rankings at a lower cost, thereby reducing the Cost Per Click (CPC). Complementing Deficiencies, Comprehensive Coverage: SEM Compensates for Long SEO Cycle: For new product launches, short-term promotional activities, or highly competitive keywords, SEM can provide instant visibility, quickly capturing the market and compensating for the slow effectiveness of SEO. SEO Compensates for High SEM Costs: Once stable organic rankings are obtained through SEO, you don’t need to pay for every click. This brings you continuous, free traffic, which can effectively reduce overall marketing costs in the long run. Completely Dominate Search Results Pages: When a brand has both paid ad placements and organic rankings on the search results page for a certain keyword, its visibility on the SERP will greatly increase. This not only boosts click-through rates but also enhances brand authority and user trust. This “double exposure” strategy can effectively squeeze out competitors’ display space.

Measures the effectiveness of ad copy and creatives: A high CTR indicates that your ad copy, headlines, and creatives are appealing to your target audience. Influences Ad Quality Score: On platforms like Google Ads, CTR is a significant component of the Ad Quality Score. A higher Quality Score may allow you to achieve better ad rankings at a lower Cost Per Click (CPC). If your CTR is low, you might need to optimize your ad copy, conduct keyword research again, or adjust your ad’s audience targeting.

Directly evaluates ad profitability: ROAS is the ultimate metric for assessing whether an ad campaign is profitable. A healthy ROAS typically indicates that your ad investment is worthwhile. Guides budget allocation: By comparing the ROAS of different ad campaigns, ad groups, or even keywords, you can prioritize allocating your budget to ads that bring higher returns. The level of ROAS directly affects whether your ad campaign can be sustained.

In the world of digital marketing, if you want to quickly gain search engine attention, Paid Search Advertising is definitely your preferred strategy. It’s often called PPC (Pay-Per-Click) advertising because, as the name suggests, you only pay when someone clicks on your ad. Simply put, paid search advertising is a way to attract website traffic and potential customers by purchasing ad placements on search engine results pages (SERPs). These ads appear in prominent positions in user search results, in the form of text, shopping listings, or videos, usually with a clear “Ad” or “Sponsored” label. ","date":"2025-09-10","objectID":"/posts/paid-search/:1:0","tags":["SEM","Digital Marketing","Google Ads"],"title":"The Ultimate Guide to Paid Search Advertising (PPC)","uri":"/posts/paid-search/"},{"categories":["SEM","Digital Marketing"],"content":"How PPC Works: A Microsecond “Auction” The operation of paid search advertising can be summarized as an efficient, real-time “auction” process that occurs every time a user searches: User Search: It all starts with the user’s search behavior. When a potential customer types a keyword into a search engine like Google or Bing, they’re signaling a clear demand. Keyword Matching: The search engine immediately scans all advertisers’ campaigns to find keywords that match the user’s search term. For example, if a user searches for “best running shoes,” ads related to keywords like “running shoes” or “sports shoes” might be triggered. Ad Auction: After finding matching ads, the search engine initiates a real-time bidding system. All eligible ads compete based on their bid and ad quality. Note that a high bid isn’t the only determining factor; the quality of the ad (e.g., relevance, landing page experience) is also crucial. Ad Display: Among the winning bids, higher-ranked ads are displayed to users at the top, bottom, or other prominent positions on the SERP. These ads will have clear “Ad” or “Sponsored” labels to distinguish them. User Click: When a user sees your ad and finds it valuable, they click through to your website. At this point, you only pay the advertising platform—this is where “pay-per-click” comes from.

Understanding their characteristics will help you choose the right platform based on your target audience and market. Google Ads (formerly Google AdWords): Huge Market Share: Dominates the global search engine market, meaning you can reach the vast majority of internet users on the Google Search Network and its extensive partner websites. Powerful and Comprehensive Features: Offers the most complete ad types, targeting options, and data analysis tools, suitable for advertisers of all sizes and goals. Rich Ecosystem: Not limited to search ads, it also includes the Display Network, YouTube video ads, app ads, etc., forming a comprehensive digital marketing ecosystem. Recommended Use Case: If your goal is to reach the widest audience and requires granular ad control and optimization, Google Ads is the first choice. Microsoft Advertising (formerly Bing Ads): Covers Microsoft Users: Primarily displays ads on search engines like Bing, Yahoo!, and AOL. Although its market share is smaller than Google, it can reach a loyal user base within the Microsoft ecosystem, for example, through Windows, Xbox, Microsoft Edge browser, etc. Unique User Demographics: Studies suggest that Microsoft Advertising’s user base may be slightly older, with relatively higher income and education levels, which can be more valuable for specific B2B or high-end product services. Relatively Less Competition, Potentially Lower Costs: Due to lower competition than Google Ads, the Cost Per Click (CPC) for some keywords may be lower, which is an advantage for advertisers with limited budgets. Easy to Import Google Ads Data: The Microsoft Advertising platform supports direct import of Google Ads campaigns, making cross-platform management convenient for advertisers. Recommended Use Case: As a complement to Google Ads, helping you expand your reach, target specific user groups, and find more cost-effective traffic when your budget is limited. Both platforms offer powerful tools to help advertisers manage and optimize their PPC campaigns. For most brands, utilizing both platforms simultaneously often leads to more comprehensive market coverage and better overall performance.

Compensating for SEO Shortcomings and Addressing AI Challenges: Dominating Search Heights While SEO can bring valuable free organic traffic, it usually takes a long time to show results, and in some highly competitive keyword areas, achieving top rankings is very difficult. More importantly, with the increasing development of AI large models and intelligent search, search engine results pages may present more summaries, answers, and integrated content, which could impact traditional SEO organic rankings, making organic traffic acquisition more challenging. Paid search advertising shows unique resilience and advantages in this context: Quickly Occupy Top Positions: Even if your website doesn’t have good organic rankings for a certain keyword, paid search can immediately place you at the top of the SERP. Regardless of how the search results page evolves, paid ad placements remain the most direct and visible traffic entry point, ensuring your brand always stays at the “commanding heights” of search. Testing and Validation: You can quickly test the commercial value and user intent of different keywords through PPC, feeding this valuable data back into your SEO strategy, guiding content creation, and even providing direction for AI-generated content. Responding to Market Changes: During holiday promotions or when popular trends emerge, PPC can respond quickly to seize fleeting market opportunities.

You can allocate budgets based on the profitability or importance of different product lines. For scientifically allocating budgets, refer to “Complete Guide to SEM Ad Costs”. Bidding Strategy: This level determines whether to use manual bidding or allow the system to automatically optimize bids to achieve goals such as clicks or conversions. Geographic Location Targeting: You can decide to display ads only in specific countries, regions, cities, or even within a certain radius. This is especially important for local service businesses. Ad Network Selection: Choose whether to display ads on the Search Network (Google Search Network), Display Network (Google Display Network), or both. Other Settings: Such as language, device type, ad scheduling, etc. Example: If you are an online course platform, you could create separate campaigns for “Front-end Development Courses,” “AI Programming Courses,” and “Introduction to Data Analysis,” each with independent budgets and target audience regions.

Ad Group: Focusing Your Niche Topics An ad group is the second level under a campaign, used to organize a set of highly related keywords and corresponding ad copy/creatives. An ad group should be built around a very specific theme or product/service category. Keywords: Each ad group should contain a set of closely related keywords. Highly relevant keywords help improve Ad Quality Score, thereby reducing Cost Per Click (CPC) and improving ad ranking. To learn how to conduct effective keyword research, please read “Keyword Research and Targeting in the AI Era”. Ad Copy \u0026 Creatives: Each ad group should contain at least 2-3 ad copies that are highly relevant to the keywords in that group. Search engines will automatically test these copies and select the best-performing ones for display. For writing compelling ad copy, refer to “Key Techniques for Writing High-Converting SEM Copy”. Landing Page: All ads in an ad group should point to a landing page that is highly relevant to the keywords and ad copy. The relevance and user experience of the landing page are crucial for improving conversion rates. To optimize your landing page, please check out “Ad Landing Page Optimization: Key to Improving Conversion Rates”. Example: Under the “Front-end Development Courses” campaign, you could create ad groups like “React Framework Course,” “Vue.js Introduction,” and “Advanced JavaScript.” In the “React Framework Course” ad group, keywords could be “React training class,” “React development tutorial,” and the corresponding ad copy would emphasize practical projects, latest versions, and career prospects.

When your selected keywords match a user’s search query, your ad has a chance to be displayed. Match Types: Keywords are not just one form; they have different Match Types that control the degree to which your ad matches a user’s search query. Broad Match: The broadest coverage, can match related phrases, synonyms, and even misspellings. Phrase Match: Matches searches that include your keyword phrase, but can have other words before or after. Exact Match: Matches searches that are identical or very similar to your keyword. Negative Keywords: Very important! These words prevent your ads from showing for irrelevant searches, avoiding unnecessary clicks and wasted budget. Example: For the keyword “React training class,” if you use broad match, it might match “best front-end framework tutorial”; if you use phrase match, it might match “React training class online”; if you use exact match, it will only match “React training class” or “React offline training.” And “free React resources” could be set as a negative keyword to avoid attracting non-paying users.

Display Path: Beautifies your URL, giving users a more intuitive expectation of the page they will land on after clicking. Ad Extensions: These are “extra benefits” for your ads that can provide more information, increase visibility, and click-through rates without increasing click costs. Common extensions include: Sitelink Extensions: Links to specific pages within your website (e.g., Contact Us, Product Categories). Callout Extensions: Short selling points or advantages (e.g., “Free Trial,” “Experienced Instructors”). Structured Snippet Extensions: Highlights your product or service attributes (e.g., “Course Types: Hands-on, Theory, Project-based”). Call Extensions: Directly displays a phone number, making it easy for users to call with one click. Image Extensions: Directly displays images related to the course in the ad (e.g., learning interface, certificates), making it more eye-catching. Example: An ad copy for “React Training Class” might include a headline like “React Full-Stack Development | Real Project Driven | Enroll Now,” supplemented by a description like “Experienced mentors guide you from beginner to expert, quickly mastering core technologies,” and use sitelink extensions to directly link to “Course Details” and “Student Cases” pages.

For budget allocation, refer to “Complete Guide to SEM Ad Costs”. Bidding: Choose a bidding strategy: For beginners: Start with “Maximize Clicks.” This will help you get as many clicks as possible within your budget, allowing you to quickly gather data. Advanced users: Once you’ve accumulated enough data (usually 15-30 conversions), consider switching to “Maximize Conversions” or “Target CPA (Cost Per Acquisition),” allowing Google Ads to automatically optimize for your conversion goals.

Cost Per Click (CPC): A high CPC can quickly drain your budget. If a keyword’s CPC is unusually high, you need to analyze its competition, Quality Score, or try adjusting bids. Conversion Rate (CVR): A low conversion rate might point to a poor landing page experience, insufficient appeal of the product/service itself, or ads reaching the wrong user group. Return On Ad Spend (ROAS) or Cost Per Acquisition (CPA): These metrics, which directly measure ad profitability, are the ultimate litmus test. For a detailed explanation of these metrics, please read “The Complete Guide to SEM Data Analysis”. 2. Precisely Optimize Keywords, Improve Relevance Keywords are the core of paid search advertising, and continuous optimization can significantly improve ad performance. Expand New Keywords: Regularly conduct keyword research to discover new high-intent, low-competition long-tail keywords. You can find terms users actually searched for and triggered your ads in Google Ads’ “Search Terms Report” to uncover new opportunities. Add Negative Keywords: This is a powerful tool to reduce wasted spending. Regularly review the search terms report and add irrelevant terms that triggered your ads (e.g., “free,” “used,” “part-time”) to your negative keyword list. Adjust Match Types: Fine-tune match types based on keyword performance. For broad match keywords with high spend but poor conversions, consider tightening to phrase or exact match; for well-performing exact match terms, you might broaden the match type to gain more traffic. Pause Ineffective Keywords: Decisively pause or delete keywords that consume budget for a long time without generating any conversions or that have excessively high conversion costs. 3. Continuously Optimize Ad Copy and Creatives Ad copy is the first line of defense for attracting user clicks. Even well-performing copy needs continuous testing and iteration. A/B Test Headlines and Descriptions: Use Google Ads’ Responsive Search Ads (RSA) feature to provide multiple headline and description options. The platform will automatically test different combinations and favor displaying the best performers. Regularly replace underperforming headlines and descriptions, introducing new selling points or CTAs. Update Ad Extensions: Ensure your ad extensions (e.g., sitelink extensions, callout extensions, call extensions) are up-to-date and synchronized with promotions or new service highlights. Maintain Consistency with Landing Page: Ensure that the content promised in the ad copy is delivered on the landing page, improving user experience and conversion intent. 4. Optimize Landing Page Experience, Increase Conversion Rate After a user clicks on an ad and lands on your landing page, the landing page becomes their “decision-making battlefield.” An excellent landing page can efficiently convert traffic into sales or leads. Improve Loading Speed: Use tools like Google PageSpeed Insights to detect and optimize your landing page’s loading speed. Slow loading is one of the main reasons users abandon a page. Enhance Content Relevance: Ensure that the content, images, and videos on your landing page highly match the ad copy and search intent that led the user there. Clear Call-to-Action (CTA): CTA buttons should be prominent and clearly worded, such as “Buy Now,” “Sign Up for Free,” “Get a Quote.” Simplify Forms: If your landing page includes forms, try to minimize the information required, shortening the conversion path.

Which one should I choose? A1: Paid Search Advertising (PPC) and Search Engine Optimization (SEO) are both part of Search Engine Marketing (SEM), but they acquire traffic differently. PPC (Paid Search Advertising): Uses paid ad placements, with ads labeled “Ad” or “Sponsored,” gaining instant visibility and traffic, but requiring continuous budget investment. SEO (Search Engine Optimization): Achieves higher search rankings naturally by optimizing website content and technical aspects, providing “free” and long-term stable traffic, but typically takes longer to show results. Which to choose? It’s recommended to use both in combination. PPC can quickly gain market share and test keywords, compensating for SEO’s slower results; while SEO can bring long-term, free, and highly trusted organic traffic. In a mature digital marketing strategy, they are complementary, not competing. To learn more, please read the section on SEM vs. SEO comparison in “What is SEM? A Beginner’s Guide”.

A2: It’s recommended to advertise on both platforms, or at least start with Google Ads. Google Ads has the largest global search market share, a massive user base, and comprehensive, powerful features, making it the preferred choice for most advertisers. Microsoft Advertising covers Microsoft users (Bing, Yahoo!, etc.). Its user demographic may be slightly older and have higher income levels, and competition is relatively lower, sometimes offering traffic at a lower cost. It can serve as an effective complement to Google Ads, expanding your audience reach.

A3: Quality Score is a diagnostic tool Google Ads uses to measure the relevance and quality of your ads, keywords, and landing pages, with a score ranging from 1-10. It’s mainly influenced by three factors: Expected Click-Through Rate (Expected CTR): Your ad’s anticipated click performance for a given keyword. Ad Relevance: How closely your ad copy relates to your keywords. Landing Page Experience: The relevance of your landing page to your ad and keywords, user-friendliness, loading speed, etc. Why is it important? A high Quality Score means your ad is more likely to get a higher ad rank at a lower Cost Per Click (CPC). Simply put, it helps you get better ad positions for less money. Continuously optimizing your campaigns to improve Quality Score is key to boosting ROI. For more details on Quality Score, refer to the article “The Complete Guide to SEM Data Analysis”.

A4: Your ad campaign budget depends on your business goals, the value of your product/service, the competitiveness of your target market, and your desired return on investment. There is no “one-size-fits-all” number. You can start with a small budget for testing and gradually adjust based on ad performance. Consider Cost Per Click (CPC): Use keyword research tools to estimate the average CPC for your target keywords, and combine this with your desired number of clicks to roughly estimate your daily budget. Focus on ROI: The ultimate goal is to achieve a positive return on investment. Even with a limited budget, if it drives profitable conversions, it’s an effective investment.

In my test account, AI-generated creatives were mostly titles, making up as much as 80% of the total. This ratio is very significant. It suggests that AI Max’s creative strategy favors high-frequency title testing. Titles are the most visible element of an ad and have the biggest impact on CTR. By generating a large volume of different titles, the AI can rapidly A/B test to find the copy that best resonates with users. The AI generates about 12 new titles or descriptions per day. I even observed that some AI-generated titles significantly exceeded the traditional 30-character limit for Google Ads. This indicates that AI Max is using an independent creative system with its own rules, separate from the traditional ones. This also explains why AI Max’s automatically-generated creatives do not appear in the same backend data tables as the ones advertisers provide. They are completely isolated in a different data stream, which means AI Max is not just a simple creative tool but a parallel system with its own logic and rules.

Furthermore, I speculate that the AI has a tendency to recognize text within images. This suggests that AI Max may be “smarter” than we think when it comes to gathering information, as it tries to understand all available content on a page. However, this mechanism also presents a typical “black box” problem. While we can see what copy the AI has generated, we don’t know exactly what part of the landing page it came from or how it was sourced. What’s more, we can currently only see the impressions for these creatives, not critical metrics like clicks or cost. This data asymmetry makes it challenging to evaluate their performance.

AI-generated copy doesn’t update in real time with the landing page. For example, even if you updated your landing page on August 1st and removed certain phrases, the AI might still generate copy containing that old information on August 2nd. This latency can cause a mismatch between your ad and your landing page, confusing users. This not only hurts the user experience but can also lower your conversion rate. What’s more, these risks add to our workload. To ensure the accuracy and consistency of our ad copy, we have to regularly check the AI-generated creatives and manually remove those that don’t meet our standards. This contradicts AI Max’s original purpose of reducing workload. The most direct value of AI Max’s ad creative generation is its ability to act as an endless creative engine, continuously generating new headlines and descriptions that significantly reduce the manual work of writing ad copy. This automated content generation, based on landing page content, also gives us new creative directions. However, this “black box” is far from perfect. It introduces the risks of uncontrollable content, update lag, and data opacity. To ensure ad consistency and marketing effectiveness, we have to spend extra time reviewing and correcting the AI’s output. This contradicts its initial purpose of being a fully automated tool. Therefore, our role must change. We are no longer mere copywriters but managers and supervisors of AI-generated creatives. My final recommendations are: Provide high-quality input: Give the AI clear, precise, and highly relevant landing page content, as this is key to guiding it toward generating effective creatives. Maintain continuous monitoring: Regularly check the AI-generated copy and promptly remove irrelevant or ambiguous content. Understand and accept its limitations: The AI’s automation is powerful, but it still requires human supervision and correction to ensure accuracy and maximize its value.

Its core concept is simple: you provide some basic information, and the AI finds the most relevant users, automating your ad campaigns. For advertisers, this sounds very convenient. But a question quickly arises: how exactly does this powerful AI work? Its internal decision-making process is invisible to us. We know what we put in and what comes out, but everything in between is like a “black box.” In this article, I’ll share some of my findings from a test I ran on the AI Max keyword matching feature. My goal is to use my real data and observations to give you a more practical perspective. Before we dive in, let’s clarify two basic concepts, as they are key to understanding AI Max: Keywords: These are the words you set in your Google Ads account, telling the system what your ads are about. Search Terms: These are the actual words or phrases users type into the Google search bar. AI Max’s job is to match your ads to these real user searches.

This led to our first question: Is AI Max just optimizing our existing keywords? The test results gave us a clear answer: The search terms matched by AI Max and those matched by traditional methods have zero overlap. This means AI Max isn’t fighting for traffic in the existing pool; it’s independently creating a new matching channel. Our data shows that while this new channel’s share of traffic and cost is currently small: Traffic Share: Traditional keywords account for about 90%, while AI Max matches account for about 10%. Cost Share: Traditional keywords account for about 92%, while AI Max matches account for about 8%. So what’s its value? While search terms matched by AI Max might overlap with those from your other campaigns that don’t have AI Max enabled, this is precisely AI Max’s core capability: it can autonomously explore and discover new, highly relevant search terms. Its value lies in its ability to automatically find long-tail keywords that you might have missed or couldn’t reach manually.

Your landing page is no longer just a traffic destination; it’s a “super keyword.” This matching method performed exceptionally well: Its CTR is the highest of all match types.

It tells us that in the world of AI Max, a good landing page can not only increase conversions but also directly impact the quality and cost of your traffic. However, a classic “black box” problem exists here. While we can see these search terms are bringing good clicks and conversions, the backend doesn’t show us which landing page’s content AI Max used to match a specific search term. This means we don’t know its decision-making criteria and can’t specifically optimize particular pages.

Our data shows that the volume of AI-matched search terms is massive. In our test account, AI-matched keywords accounted for 11% to 12% of all keywords, with an average of 150+ new ones daily. That’s a stunning number. But when we analyzed the click data for these terms, a typical “black box” phenomenon appeared: the clicks were extremely scattered. Over 76% of the terms only had 1 click. Only a few terms received multiple clicks. At first glance, this might seem disappointing. Is it a waste that the AI works so hard to find so many terms, only for most to get just one click? On the contrary, this is precisely the value of the AI Max black box. This “casting a wide net” behavior is a typical “prospecting” strategy. Manually, you would never spend the time and effort to test hundreds of long-tail keywords that might only get one or two clicks. But the AI can, and it does so efficiently at a very low cost. The core value of this model is its ability to discover potential high-converting long-tail keywords with minimal trial-and-error costs. Even if most terms perform poorly, finding just a few “golden” ones that can consistently drive conversions and even have scaling potential can bring a huge return. This is why continuous monitoring and optimization are so essential. Through this practical test, we’ve gained a clearer understanding of the AI Max keyword black box. It doesn’t just optimize our existing keywords; it independently opens up a brand new traffic channel. This channel uses two core mechanisms—keyword expansion and landing page-based matching—to find new traffic efficiently and affordably. Facing such a powerful automated tool, we don’t need to obsess over understanding every decision it makes. Its value isn’t in explainability but in its ability to explore and discover potential high-converting long-tail keywords at a speed and cost we can’t match. Therefore, the key to success is to change our mindset. Our role is no longer a pure optimizer but a data analyst and strategist. Our tasks are: Provide high-quality input: Pay special attention to optimizing landing page content, as it’s a key source for the AI to find new keywords. Maintain continuous monitoring and optimization: Regularly check the AI-matched search terms and add top performers to your core keyword list. Be results-oriented: Don’t dismiss the value of the AI’s scattered clicks. As long as your final CPA and ROI are acceptable, the tool is working effectively for you. The arrival of AI Max signals a new phase in ad campaigns. It challenges our understanding of traditional keyword optimization while offering unprecedented opportunities. Learning to use this tool correctly will be a critical skill for every optimizer in future competition.

The reason is that most AI models do not directly access your proprietary information; they mostly rely on general knowledge learned from training data. To enable AI to truly “get things done,” it requires two key components: Agents and Knowledge Bases. The agent serves as AI’s “action brain,” capable of understanding instructions, invoking tools, and executing tasks; the knowledge base acts as AI’s “memory repository,” storing enterprise data, documents, and rules so the AI can access and utilize up-to-date information.

The agent’s core ability lies in decision-making and action. Its capability to truly “move” comes from invoking various tools, which can be categorized as follows: Information Retrieval Tools Web Browsers: such as Chrome or Edge, used for real-time search and data retrieval. Database Queries: such as SQL databases or Notion databases, helping the agent access internal company information. News/Document Sources: such as RSS feeds, Google News, or corporate document libraries, providing instant reference materials. Productivity and Collaboration Tools Calendar Apps: Google Calendar, Outlook Calendar, for scheduling meetings and reminders. Email Clients: Gmail, Outlook, for sending notifications or reports. Team Collaboration Platforms: Slack, Teams, Trello, for task assignment or project updates. Data Processing and Analysis Tools Spreadsheets: Excel, Google Sheets, for calculations, organizing, and visualizing data. BI Tools: Tableau, Power BI, for generating reports or data visualizations. Execution and Automation Tools Scripts and API Calls: Python scripts, Zapier, Make, for automating tasks and cross-platform operations. Hardware Interfaces: smart home devices, printers, robots, enabling AI to interact with the physical world. With these capabilities, agents transform AI from a “talking robot” into an assistant that can truly interact with the external world and complete tasks. They are the key bridge for AI to move from “can chat” to “can act.” ","date":"2025-08-30","objectID":"/posts/agent-vs-knowledge-base/:1:0","tags":["AI"],"title":"How Agents and Knowledge Bases Enable AI to Truly Work for You","uri":"/posts/agent-vs-knowledge-base/"},{"categories":["AI"],"content":"Knowledge Bases: AI’s “Memory and Experience” If agents are AI’s “brain and hands,” then knowledge bases are its “memory center.” They store vast, precise information and are crucial for the agent when executing tasks. Knowledge bases address two major limitations of large models: Knowledge Timeliness Training data in large models usually has a cutoff date, meaning the model may not know the latest market data, news, or product updates. Knowledge bases can be updated in real-time, allowing AI to access the most current information and make more accurate decisions. Private Data Large models cannot directly access internal company documents or personal notes. Knowledge bases can store these private materials, enabling the agent to securely retrieve them as needed, supporting personalized and enterprise-specific applications. Technically, knowledge bases are often used together with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). RAG is a technique that combines information retrieval with generation models. Its core idea is that before generating an answer, the system first retrieves relevant information from external knowledge bases or documents, and then uses that information to generate a more accurate and context-aware response. RAG involves three main steps: Understanding and Vectorization AI converts the user’s question or instruction into a vector representation (embedding) for matching with document vectors in the knowledge base. Information Retrieval The system retrieves the most relevant documents or data fragments from the knowledge base based on vector similarity. Methods like vector search or BM25 are often used to ensure high relevance. Answer Generation The retrieved content is provided as context to the language model, which generates a response based on both the instruction and the retrieved information. The output combines the model’s language capabilities with the latest or proprietary knowledge. For example, if you ask AI to write a “quarterly sales report summary,” without a knowledge base, it can only generate generic content from its training data, which may not reflect your company’s actual figures. With RAG, the agent first retrieves the latest sales data from internal databases or document repositories and then generates the report based on that data. This gives AI “real-time access to information,” producing answers that are both accurate and specific. Through knowledge bases, AI no longer remains a general-purpose knowledge repository; it gains its own “personal memory.” Its answers become more precise and can handle proprietary company information, upgrading AI from “can chat” to “can understand, act, and remember.” ","date":"2025-08-30","objectID":"/posts/agent-vs-knowledge-base/:2:0","tags":["AI"],"title":"How Agents and Knowledge Bases Enable AI to Truly Work for You","uri":"/posts/agent-vs-knowledge-base/"},{"categories":["AI"],"content":"Integrated Products: When “Brain” Meets “Memory” With AI technology advancing, integrated products that deeply combine agents and knowledge bases are now available. These products not only provide storage but also embed the agent, allowing users to interact directly with AI without complex setup. Based on the source of the knowledge base, these products can be roughly divided into two types: Private Knowledge Bases Products like NotebookLM and Tencent IMA allow you to upload personal or corporate documents, which then become the knowledge base. The embedded agent can understand instructions like “summarize this” or “answer questions” and directly analyze and generate responses from the documents, enabling true “instant Q\u0026A.” Real-Time Dynamic Knowledge Bases Products like Perplexity feature real-time, dynamic knowledge bases. When a question is asked, the agent instantly queries search engines, retrieves the latest information from the web, and generates an answer. This ensures AI can handle breaking news, real-time data, or new product information immediately. These integrated products make the “agent + knowledge base” combination accessible, greatly lowering the barrier for individuals and enterprises to use AI. AI is no longer just a “chatting tool” but a smart assistant that can solve real problems and support decision-making.

The workflow is as follows: Step 1: Understanding and Planning (Agent) Once the task is assigned, the agent first interprets your instructions and plans. It determines: “What information do I need? Which data and documents are key? What steps are required to complete the report?” This is the AI’s “brainstorming” stage, formulating a clear action plan. Step 2: Retrieval and Acquisition (Knowledge Base) With a plan in place, the agent retrieves relevant files and data from the knowledge base. It may consult sales spreadsheets, product progress documents, or internal meeting notes to ensure the information is comprehensive and reliable. This step gives AI “memory,” granting access to the latest and private materials. Step 3: Integration and Generation (Agent) After gathering the necessary information, the agent integrates and analyzes the data, organizing scattered content into a logically structured report. The final output accurately reflects company status and meets your expression requirements, achieving the goal of a “task-completing” AI. Through this collaborative mechanism, agents and knowledge bases act as a perfect combination of “brain” and “memory”: the agent makes decisions and executes tasks, while the knowledge base provides information and experience. Together, they enable AI not only to answer questions but also to proactively complete complex tasks, becoming a true intelligent assistant.

In today’s digital world, we interact with “content” almost every day. Whether browsing websites, scrolling through short videos, using mobile apps, or chatting with smart assistants, the core of these experiences is various forms of content. In other words, content has become the primary medium through which we communicate, gather information, and make decisions. However, despite being ubiquitous, content often faces a common problem: fragmentation and duplication. Many companies need to present similar information across different platforms. As a result, a product description is written once for the website, again for the mobile app, and again for the customer service FAQ. Information across channels may vary slightly, causing user confusion or even undermining the brand’s credibility. For content creators, this repetitive work wastes time and increases the likelihood of errors. For example, consider an e-commerce company launching a new smartphone. The product team writes a description for the website, the operations team writes a similar version for the app, and the customer service team creates an FAQ based on the same information. If a product specification changes—for instance, storage capacity from “128GB” to “256GB”—all sources must be manually updated. Missing even one spot leads to inconsistent information. This is why we need to rethink the essence of “content” and how to manage it more efficiently. To address these issues, the concept of Content Engineering emerged.

If “content creation” is writing articles, filming videos, or recording podcasts, Content Engineering is more like building the underlying system for that content. A simple formula to understand it: Content Engineering = Content Strategy + Technical Implementation Content Strategy: Determines what type of content to produce, for whom, and in what context it will be used. Technical Implementation: Uses tools, platforms, and standards to store, modularize, reuse, and distribute content. Its goals are clear: Make content more structured (modular instead of one large block), More intelligent (understandable and usable by search engines and AI), More efficiently reusable (one piece of content can be applied across multiple channels). An analogy: Content creators are like “craftspeople,” creating works with text, images, or video. Content engineers are like “architects,” designing how these works are split, combined, managed, and delivered. They care not just whether the “house” is built, but whether the materials and structure allow flexibility and easy modification.

Content Management (CMS): Focuses on storing, publishing, and updating content, e.g., writing articles, uploading images, updating pages. Content Engineering: Goes further, emphasizing structured content and cross-channel reuse. It turns content into “Lego blocks” that can be flexibly combined and automatically presented across different contexts. Think of it this way: Content management is like a “warehouse manager,” placing content on the right shelves. Content engineering is like a “design engineer,” ensuring that once content enters the system, it can automatically be used on websites, apps, smart speakers, and AI assistants without repeated manual effort.

In the internet advertising ecosystem, an ad network plays a crucial but often overlooked role. Simply put, it acts like a middleman, connecting advertisers and publishers, enabling ads to circulate efficiently across websites, apps, and video platforms. Without ad networks, advertisers would need to negotiate with each media individually, which is very inefficient. At the same time, small and medium-sized websites or apps would struggle to connect with enough advertisers, often leaving ad space unsold. Ad networks solve this “two-sided problem.” The value of ad networks can be summarized in several key points: Traffic Aggregation They consolidate ad inventory scattered across long-tail media into large-scale traffic pools. For advertisers, this means “one access, multiple placements,” reducing campaign costs. For publishers, it helps them find ad demand more quickly and minimize unsold inventory. Targeted Distribution Ad networks tag ad inventory with information such as user location, interests, device type, and browsing behavior. Advertisers can target their campaigns to reach users more likely to engage. This improves ad performance and ROI. Price Standardization Different websites and apps often have their own pricing, making comparisons difficult. Ad networks standardize billing models (CPM, CPC, CPA, etc.) and data metrics, making pricing transparent and measurable. Advertisers can plan budgets more easily, and publishers can sell inventory fairly.

When it comes to images, many people’s first thought is that “inserting an image means adding an image directly.” However, in Obsidian, images are more like references to “external files.” In other words, the images aren’t directly embedded in the note content but are stored in folders on your computer and then displayed in the notes through links or references. This explains why deleting an image from a note doesn’t remove the image file from the folder—the note only references it, while the image file itself remains independent. Understanding this is key to better managing your image resources, such as consolidating them into a dedicated folder to avoid clutter and facilitate future backups and organization.

Pros: Simple operation, no need to worry about file paths. Cons: If you’re not careful, images may end up scattered in multiple locations, and the attachments folder can become messy over time, making management difficult. As shown in the image below, I copied and pasted an image into the editor. Obsidian automatically saved the image in the root directory, separate from other existing folders.

If your image is in a subfolder of the vault, such as an assets folder, the path would be written as: ![[assets/image-filename.png]] Alternatively, you can use standard Markdown syntax: ![](assets/image-filename.png) Pros: You have full control over where the images are stored, avoiding a cluttered attachments folder.

First, let’s understand the concept of bidirectional links in Obsidian: Bidirectional links (Backlinks) are one of Obsidian’s most core and valuable features. Their significance lies in: Not only can you “reference” other notes, but Obsidian also automatically shows you “which notes mention the current one.” This “mutual awareness” is what sets Obsidian apart from traditional note-taking tools: You don’t manually organize structure—notes “build networks” on their own. For example, suppose you have two notes: Note A: What is Markdown? Note B: Obsidian Features Overview In Note B, you write: Obsidian supports [[What is Markdown?]] format. What did you do? You linked Note A in Note B. Obsidian automatically displays a “backlink” in Note A: “This note is referenced by Obsidian Features Overview.” Compare “forward links” and “backlinks”: Type Concept Example Forward Link Manually linking another note with [[ ]] In B, type [[A]] Backlink Obsidian shows you which notes mention this one In A, see: “Referenced by B” In other words: Forward links are you saying, “I reference who” Backlinks are the system telling you, “Who references me” Why Are Bidirectional Links Important? Traditional notes are tree-structured (category → subcategory → file), which easily becomes messy. Obsidian’s bidirectional links let you build a networked knowledge structure, where notes freely connect and cross-reference. This helps you: String ideas together Rediscover forgotten content Build your “second brain” How to View Backlinks in Obsidian? When you open a note: In the bottom-right or right sidebar, there’s a “Backlinks” panel It shows “which notes mention this one” You can click these notes to quickly jump to their context In summary: Bidirectional links = Automatically building a knowledge network, no longer taking isolated notes, but letting information interconnect to form a system. How to Create Bidirectional Links Let’s try a simple demo: Create Another New Note Follow the earlier steps to create a note named Study Plan Add the Following Content: I’ll start planning based on the content of [[My First Note]]. Now, you’ll see “My First Note” highlighted and clickable. In the right panel, you’ll see a line connecting “Study Plan” and “My First Note”: In the link view, you can also see “Study Plan” linking to “My First Note”: “My First Note” has a backlink from “Study Plan”: Click [[My First Note]] You’ll jump to that note. Now you’ve built a bidirectional link structure, where notes can jump between each other like web pages and automatically track references. The first time you open Obsidian, it might feel empty, but once you get used to linking notes, it becomes increasingly engaging. Next, I’ll cover more practical uses, like plugin recommendations, search tips, and daily writing organization. If you’re also using Obsidian, let’s explore it together.

But one exception remains critical and controllable: content. Whether for SEO or SEM, the core question is the same: “When users search for this term, what valuable content can you provide?” AI decides what to serve, to whom, and where to land based on its holistic understanding of your website content, ad creatives, and user behavior. Thus, content quality, structure, and consistency become the core levers for true collaboration between SEO and SEM. Why is unifying content structure so important? Helps AI correctly understand website content intent Unified expressions in titles, paragraphs, and module layouts help AI assess the relevance between page topics and user search intent. Avoids semantic disconnects where SEO pages emphasize informational completeness while SEM landing pages overly compress content. Optimizes the system’s evaluation and recommendation of page value AI uses structural cues (e.g., H-tags, lists, FAQs) to assess page richness and relevance. Unified structures create clearer signal loops between organic and paid paths. Improves content asset reuse and maintenance efficiency Identical information architectures enable quick adaptation across multiple channels. Large-scale content production and iteration become more manageable and efficient. Suppose you’re a company offering enterprise CRM systems. Your SEO team conducts thorough keyword research and builds well-structured, comprehensive pages around search intents like “customer relationship management software” and “sales automation tools,” with modules including product features, use cases, customer testimonials, FAQs, and CTAs. Meanwhile, the SEM team runs AI Max for Search ads with independently crafted landing pages. These pages are more “sales-driven”—shorter in structure, more exaggerated in language, stripping out explanatory content and leaving only slogans and sign-up buttons. In the era of manual ad placement, A/B testing could work, but under AI Max, problems arise: AI cannot accurately grasp your core value proposition When matching searches for “CRM system automation,” the system sees SEO pages highlighting “customer data management and sales process integration,” while ad landing pages only say “double your sales.” This semantic inconsistency makes it hard for AI to judge intent alignment, reducing placement precision. The system prefers pages with complete structures and stable signals SEO pages, with FAQs, internal links, and higher dwell times, provide clearer signals for AI to evaluate. Ad pages, with simpler structures and sparse behavioral data, lose priority in URL expansion or placements. Dual maintenance burdens content teams, lowering optimization efficiency Maintaining two inconsistent sets of pages wastes resources and prevents AI models from learning unified user behavior logic from historical data, ultimately hurting conversion performance. This example shows that in AI Max for Search’s logic, you can no longer guide ad placements through artificial divisions or channel segregation. The system speaks only one language: structured, intent-aligned, and signal-stable content. Unifying content structure is the prerequisite for AI to “understand who you are.” ","date":"2025-06-26","objectID":"/posts/ai-max-for-search-seo-sem-collaboration-customer-acquisition/:2:0","tags":["SEM","SEO","AI","Digital Marketing"],"title":"How Can SEO and SEM Collaborate to Adapt to AI Max for Search?","uri":"/posts/ai-max-for-search-seo-sem-collaboration-customer-acquisition/"},{"categories":["SEM","SEO","AI","Digital Marketing"],"content":"How to Unify SEO and SEM Structures?

Many teams ponder this before adopting AI Max for Search: if the system favors clear, intent-aligned content pages, should they **ditch traditional landing pages and optimize their website for ad承接? The recommendation: Don’t abandon landing pages, but “website-ize” them—align their structure, semantics, and behavior with your main site. Why? Landing pages still excel in design freedom and conversion efficiency, especially for promotions, launches, and high-tempo campaigns. But AI no longer just “executes settings”—it picks intent-matching, data-rich pages from your entire site. Disjointed content is noise. Future ad landing pages must structurally resemble your website, conversion-focused, yet technically recognizable as part of your trusted content network. Implementation tips: Adopt unified page templates (e.g., product highlights → user value → case studies → FAQs → CTA) across website and ads. Integrate top-performing landing pages into main navigation or sitemaps for structural cohesion. Establish cross-team (SEO/SEM) content workflows: produce once, deploy everywhere, boosting efficiency and AI recognition.

Precise Optimization Offsets Pressure: Sellers control traffic quality and costs by more refined keyword selection, negative keyword settings, and audience targeting optimization, only targeting high-value users, offsetting some of the negative impact of a deteriorating bidding environment.

Sellers Strategically Scale Back Ad Spend: Focus on Long-Tail/Low-Competition Keywords: Sellers may actively abandon competitive, high-CPC popular broad keywords, instead targeting long-tail keywords with lower search volume, more precise intent, and less competition, which inherently have lower CPCs. Reduce Ad Targeting Scope: Sellers may only advertise to core markets, high-loyalty users, or their most profitable product lines, avoiding the most competitive areas, thus observing an overall or localized CPC decrease. Overall Market Demand Significantly Shrinks: If tariffs lead to widespread, significant price increases across an entire product category, and consumer demand plummets, overall market search volume and ad activity decrease, competition weakens, which may lead to CPC reductions. However, this is usually accompanied by a larger decline in sales, which is not good for the overall market.

Inventory Current Conversion Rates by Market Check conversion rates by market. If conversion rates are declining in a specific country/region while remaining stable elsewhere, and the profit in that market no longer supports the marketing budget, then consider reducing or even pausing ad spend and reallocating the budget. Re-evaluate Pricing and Value Proposition Carefully calculate new product costs and determine the cost pass-through ratio (fully transferred, partially transferred, temporarily absorbed). Reallocate Ad Budget Based on 1 and 2 Scale back inefficient markets: For countries/regions with high tariff rates and significant sales declines (e.g., the US imposing a 25% tariff on specific categories), reduce the budget by 20%-50%. Explore alternative markets: Increase budgets in lower-tariff regions (e.g., Southeast Asia, the Middle East). Example: Shift 30% of the original US budget to Saudi Arabia or Mexico. Focus on high-profit products: Pause ads for products heavily impacted by tariffs and prioritize categories with profit margins \u003e40% (e.g., accessories, domestically produced goods). Adjust Smart Bidding Settings If you’re using target Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) or Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) bidding, you’ll need to set new target prices based on the new cost structure. Optimize Audience Targeting Exclude audiences with potentially low conversion efficiency. Available conditions include but are not limited to: geographic location, life events, search intent, YouTube content viewed, etc. Optimize Keywords, Creatives, and Landing Page Content Further emphasize non-price value propositions: durability, warranty, local support, sustainability, eco-friendliness. If product prices are increasing, ensure this change is transparent, helping customers understand why prices are rising. Further enhance credibility with customer reviews, return guarantees, shipping policies, etc. Align with Supply Chain and Inventory Management Communicate closely with the supply chain to anticipate the impact of tariff changes on inventory. Utilize PPC platform inventory linking features (e.g., Google Merchant Center’s inventory feed) to automatically pause ads for out-of-stock products. Plan promotional activities in advance to clear potentially accumulated inventory.

Bing Shopping Ads are product catalog-based advertisements within Microsoft’s advertising platform. They dynamically display product images, prices, and names to directly engage users with commercial intent. Key Differences from Traditional Search Ads: No Keyword Bidding: Ads are automatically matched to user search terms based on product attributes (titles, descriptions, categories). Visual Presentation: Image-centric formats (similar to e-commerce platforms) enhance click-through rates. Common Ad Placements: Product carousels at the top of Bing search results (labeled “Sponsored”). Microsoft partner platforms (e.g., Yahoo Shopping, AOL search results). Operational Mechanism Data Source: Microsoft Merchant Center Advertisers must create a product feed (including titles, descriptions, prices, stock status, image links) in Microsoft Merchant Center. Feeds undergo strict validation (e.g., price consistency with official websites, images ≥800×800 pixels). Ad Trigger Logic Search Term Matching: User queries (e.g., “men’s sneakers”) are linked to product titles/categories. Contextual Expansion: Ads may appear for semantically related terms (e.g., showing sneaker ads for “gym outfit ideas”).

Visual subjects are formed through combination or deformation. Low Detail Processing Reduce textures and decorative details on model surfaces, retaining only essential contour features to emphasize clean overall forms. Soft Color Schemes Predominantly use low-saturation tones (e.g., Morandi color palette) with gentle light-dark contrasts, avoiding high contrast or fluorescent colors. Highly Simplified Elements Retain only core visual information in compositions, eliminating redundant backgrounds or decorative elements. Use negative space to enhance subject focus. Abstract Representation Weaken realistic object forms through proportional adjustments or symbolic designs, such as using simplified cloud outlines instead of detailed depictions. Lightweight Textures Employ matte or translucent material effects, avoiding complex light reflections. Use basic highlights to suggest metallic/glass elements. Flattened Spatial Sense Minimize perspective depth through parallel viewing angles or mild axonometric projection, reducing scene layering. Function-Oriented Design Serve information delivery or interface interaction needs, emphasizing visual symbols’ readability and quick recognition over pure decoration.

Return rates by category (e.g., apparel sizing issues). Content Preferences: Product categories (e.g., beauty/electronics). Content formats (video/text/UGC). Discount responsiveness. 2. Traffic Sources (Channel Attributes) Match content to channel characteristics: Paid Ads: Search Ads (Google): Keyword-driven demand → Direct product displays. Social Ads (Meta/TikTok): Visual appeal → Interactive elements (short videos). Retargeting Ads (Criteo): Highlight abandoned actions (e.g., price drops). Organic Traffic: SEO: Long-tail queries (e.g., “best budget laptop”) → Comparison guides. Social Organic: KOL/content hashtags → Source-aligned pages. Direct Traffic: Loyal users → Member-exclusive content. 3. User Attributes (Static Traits) Demographic-based targeting: Demographics: Age, gender, occupation, income. Geographics: Location/climate (e.g., winter gear for Nordic users). Cultural factors (language, holidays, taboos). Device Data: Mobile (simplified flows) vs Desktop (information density).

Hugo prioritizes templates in the root layouts/ directory. If baseof.html doesn’t exist there, copy it from the theme directory first. Does Disabling Text Selection Affect SEO? No direct impact. Search engine crawlers (e.g., Google Bot) primarily parse HTML source code rather than being restricted by CSS styles. The user-select: none property only prevents mouse-based text selection by users. Text remains visible in the HTML source, fully accessible to crawlers. Search engines ignore most CSS styles (except techniques like display: none or visibility: hidden), so user-select: none won’t affect crawling or indexing.

Support fast iteration: because it is a customized page, it has high flexibility in adjusting content and design, and will not affect other businesses. Easy data analysis: the overall CTA logic of the page is basically consistent, the number of user paths is small, and only a small number of channels use this page, which is convenient for subsequent analysis of data effects.

Keep the top navigation bar: Users can understand the general structure of the website through the navigation bar and freely jump to the page they are interested in. Advantages: Cost savings: No additional design and development involved. Strengthen brand consistency: Ensure the overall experience of users on the official website, and at the same time have user comments, third-party evaluation certificates and other pages as support for brand credibility. Disadvantages: Relatively low conversion rate: The official website content is more brand-oriented, and the information is not focused enough. Users are easily distracted by other content such as navigation bars and internal links. Difficult to iterate quickly and data is mixed: Different channels will use official website pages, and content and design adjustments require the consent of multiple parties before they can be promoted. The multiple behavioral paths of users on the website also increase the difficulty of data analysis. As for which form or website structure is better, it still depends on the brand’s own focus and marketing strategy. Take the landing page of monday.com as an example: it is not difficult to find that monday.com uses the official website homepage (https://monday.com/) to accept users who search for its brand words, and uses dedicated landing pages (such as https://monday.com/ap/project-management) to meet users who search for other keywords (here I use project management).

Ambiguous Geographic Intent: Handling vague descriptions (e.g., “coffee shops nearby”) by combining real-time user location (via IP address or device GPS) or search history to infer the specific range. Multilingual/Multi-Region Adaptation: For example, when a user searches for “München,” it may cater to German-speaking users or those in Germany, automatically associating it with “Munich.” Geolocation and Personalized Ranking IP Address and Device Location: Prioritizing local results for the user’s region (e.g., searching “weather” directly displays forecasts for the current location). Regionalized Ranking Strategies: The same query yields different results in different regions (e.g., “food delivery platform” shows DoorDash in New York and Demae-can in Tokyo). Multi-Location Intent: Users may explicitly specify non-local regions (e.g., a Beijing user searching for “Shanghai travel guide”), requiring intent differentiation.

Regional phrases or cultural references (e.g., “National Day Golden Week” targets Chinese users). Technical Signals: Server location (a secondary reference, though CDNs may weaken this signal). Country-code top-level domains (e.g., .de, .jp) or subdirectories (e.g., example.com/de/). Geographic Relevance Evaluation and Indexing Regionalized Indexing: Pages are categorized and stored by geographic relevance (e.g., “Japan travel” pages are filed under the Asia index partition). Local SEO Weighting: Google My Business profile completeness, local backlinks (e.g., citations from regional media). Density of local keywords on the page (e.g., repeated mentions of “San Francisco Bay Area remodeling company”). Multi-Region Targeting: Use hreflang tags to differentiate language/region versions.

The core competition in digital marketing has shifted from “acquiring traffic” to “screening high-quality users.” With rising traffic costs and increasingly complex user behavior, blindly pursuing user quantity leads to resource waste: Low-quality users may generate short-term clicks but fail to deliver long-term returns (e.g., fake clicks, coupon abuse). By evaluating user quality, businesses can precisely identify high-value segments, allocate budgets to conversion-ready users, and avoid ineffective spending. The essence of user quality assessment lies in identifying real value through cohort analysis. Traditional traffic metrics often obscure user heterogeneity - users acquired during the same period may generate vastly different value due to channel sources, motivations, and behavioral patterns.

The ads promoted “first-order discounts + free shipping,” aiming to boost registration conversions and initial purchases. The campaign targeted new users through Facebook, Google, and Instagram. Based on daily operational reports and monthly summaries, the campaign appeared highly successful: Channel New Registrations First-Order Conversion Rate Average Order Value (USD) CAC (USD) Facebook Ads 12,000 5.2% $46.8 $21.4 Google Ads 8,500 4.8% $49.3 $18.7 Instagram 4,200 6.0% $42.1 $19.8 Compared to the previous quarter’s averages: Average first-order conversion rate increased from 4.1% to 5.2% CAC remained below the annual cap ($25) Monthly new registrations grew by nearly 1.7x From conventional metrics, this campaign achieved a “high-traffic + low-cost” win-win and was preliminarily deemed a “replicable strategy.” However, during the routine review, the data team raised a critical question: Is this growth truly sustainable, or is it just a short-term spike driven by discounts? The key issue isn’t whether “the data is correct” but rather which analytical perspective we use to interpret it.

In digital marketing analytics, we often encounter two distinct approaches: Non-Cohort Analysis and Cohort Analysis.

It provides a “snapshot” of overall metrics like conversion rate, CAC, and GMV for that period. Key Features Time-Sliced: Data is tied to when actions occurred (e.g., “June 1, 2024, cross-channel conversion rate”). Horizontal Comparison: Instant status snapshot (e.g., click costs by channel for the day). Quick Response: Supports hourly adjustments (e.g., detecting abnormal CPM spikes by 3 PM). In our opening case, “new registrations,” “first-order conversion rate,” and “CAC” are classic Non-Cohort metrics. This approach offers: Simplicity: Quick evaluation of overall marketing performance. Periodic Monitoring: Ideal for routine KPI tracking. Cross-Channel Comparison: Understands broad traffic and conversion trends. But it has clear drawbacks: Ignores registration time differences and behavioral path variations. May mask user quality issues in certain channels or periods. Fails to capture behavioral changes and value contributions over the user lifecycle.

Key Features Time-Anchored: Behaviors are measured from the starting event (e.g., Day 7/Day 30 retention for “January 2024 sign-ups”). Longitudinal Tracking: Observes how the same group evolves (e.g., annual repurchase curves for users registered in different months). Causal Validation: Precisely assesses long-term impacts of actions (e.g., how an August redesign affected retention for users acquired then). For example, grouping users who registered from March 1–7 (Cohort 1) and March 8–14 (Cohort 2), then tracking their first-order conversions, repurchase rates, and return rates over time, constitutes Cohort Analysis. Its advantages include: Precise behavioral insights: Maps user value lifecycle trajectories. Granular channel/activity effects: Identifies long-term contributions by acquisition source. Root-cause discovery: Avoids misleading surface-level data. Returning to our jewelry brand case, let’s examine Facebook data with Cohort Analysis: Registration Week Sign-Ups Week 1 Repurchase Rate Week 2 Repurchase Rate Week 3 Repurchase Rate March 1–7 4,000 5.8% 3.1% 1.2% March 8–14 4,500 6.2% 3.0% 1.0% March 15–21 3,500 5.5% 2.8% 0.8% While Week 1 repurchase rates were decent, they plummeted over time, indicating poor long-term retention. In contrast, Google’s cohort repurchase rates were: Registration Week Sign-Ups Week 1 Repurchase Rate Week 2 Repurchase Rate Week 3 Repurchase Rate March 1–7 3,000 7.2% 5.1% 3.6% March 8–14 3,000 7.0% 5.3% 3.9% March 15–21 2,500 6.8% 5.0% 3.7% Google users maintained higher repurchase rates, showing stronger stickiness. Conclusion: While Facebook excelled in initial conversions, its users’ long-term value lagged behind Google’s.

This information can be simple contact information, questionnaire answers, or complex orders or application content. Through Webform, the website can establish a two-way connection with the visitor, thereby achieving the goal of information collection, conversion or interaction. Common types of Webform and corresponding examples There are many types of Webform. The following are several common types and practical application examples: Registration form Used for users to create an account or subscribe to a service, usually including fields such as name, email address, and password. For example, the registration form of LinkedIn allows users to quickly join the platform and get professional content and connections. Contact form It is used for users to contact the company directly, suitable for support, feedback or consultation needs. For example, Apple’s support page provides a simple contact form to help users quickly submit technical questions or inquire about services. Survey form It is used for market research or collecting user feedback, usually including multiple choice and open-ended questions. SurveyMonkey’s survey form is widely used for user satisfaction surveys and product feedback collection. Payment form It is used to enter payment information when shopping online, usually combined with a payment gateway. For example, the payment form provided by Shopify allows merchants and consumers to complete the entire process of order payment. Event registration form It is used to collect registration for conferences, webinars or training. Forms like Eventbrite allow users to quickly register and attend upcoming events. The role of Webforms Webforms are not only interactive tools on websites, but also an important means to promote business goals. With Webforms, companies can interact with customers more efficiently and increase conversion opportunities. Specific functions include: Data collection and analysis Webforms are an efficient way to collect user information. Whether it is basic user information such as name and email address, or deeper personal needs, preferences and behavior data, they can be quickly collected through forms. For example, Airbnb uses booking forms to collect accommodation needs from potential customers and help them customize personalized recommendations. Drive user conversion Optimally designed Webforms can reduce the barriers for users to fill out forms, thereby increasing submission rates. Simple forms and clear calls to action (such as “Register now” or “Get a quote”) can effectively increase user action intentions and thus increase conversion rates. For example, Dropbox has effectively reduced user churn by simplifying its registration form, requiring only email and password. Enhance user trust and experience A well-designed Webform can enhance the professionalism and user experience of the website and help build user trust. The form needs to be easy to understand, with clear error prompts and avoid complicated steps. For example, Zappos’s form design focuses on user comfort, providing clear field labels and friendly operation prompts, so that users feel that the filling process is smooth and unobstructed. Automated marketing and customer relationship management Webform is usually integrated with automation platforms such as customer relationship management (CRM) systems and email marketing tools, which can instantly transmit user information to the back-end system and trigger subsequent marketing actions. For example, Mailchimp’s subscription form can automatically store subscriber information in its system and send welcome emails and subsequent marketing content in real time.

Whether you are designing a simple registration form or a complex questionnaire, it is important to follow some key design principles. By following these principles, you can not only ensure that users can fill out the form smoothly, but also increase their engagement. Here are some proven webform design best practices: Simplicity The first principle of form design is simplicity. As we all know, the simpler the better. Try to remove unnecessary fields to avoid making the form feel too cumbersome for users. Ideally, webforms should only require users to provide the most basic information - this can save users time and increase conversion rates. Every additional field is a potential abandonment point, especially for mobile users, entering long text is a big challenge. Clarity Every field in the form needs to be clear and easy to understand. Field labels should avoid industry jargon or vague wording as much as possible. It is crucial that users can quickly understand what to fill in. Clear labels can reduce users’ cognitive load and avoid confusion during the filling process. More importantly, forms should help users understand why certain information is required and ensure they know how to fill it out through short and powerful instructions or prompts. Feedback mechanism Instant feedback is the key to improving user experience. Webforms should provide instant error prompts when users are typing. By highlighting the error field and providing concise and clear error messages, users can quickly find problems and correct them. This real-time feedback not only improves the effectiveness of the form, but also reduces user frustration and encourages them to continue filling out the form. Usability With the popularity of mobile devices, Webform design must adapt to various devices, especially on mobile and tablet devices. Forms should have responsive design and automatically adjust according to screen size to ensure that users can get a smooth experience whether they are filling out on desktop, tablet or mobile phone. Buttons should be large and easy to click, and form fields should be easy to enter to avoid user experience problems caused by small screens. Trust Users often have concerns when submitting sensitive information (such as personal information or payment data). Therefore, Webform design should strengthen the establishment of trust. By clearly displaying a privacy policy, encryption technology logo, or security certification, users will feel more comfortable submitting their information. Especially in industries such as finance and e-commerce, security and privacy are key factors in users’ choice of whether to fill out a form.

Based on the best design principles, the design of Webforms should take into account the target audience, the business nature of the website, and specific functional requirements. Differences in Webform design for B-end and C-end websites B-end website (corporate website): B-end websites are usually aimed at corporate customers or professionals, and these users pay more attention to efficiency and functionality when filling out forms. Therefore, when designing B-end Webforms, the form usually contains more data fields, such as company name, position, industry, etc. At the same time, B-end users usually need more information to evaluate whether the product or service meets their needs, so the form should provide clear segmentation to avoid information overload. C-end website (consumer website): C-end websites are aimed at ordinary consumers, and users pay more attention to speed and convenience when filling out forms. In this case, the form design should be simplified as much as possible to reduce the number of steps to fill in. For example, many e-commerce websites use a single “register/login” field (such as email or mobile phone number) to avoid cumbersome steps and ensure that users complete the operation in the shortest time, thereby increasing conversion rates. Differences in Webform design in different industries E-commerce website: The Webform of an e-commerce website usually contains key content such as payment information and delivery address. In order to enhance the user’s purchase intention, special attention should be paid to the simplicity and security of the form when designing. For example, when users fill in payment information, the form should ensure that security signs (such as SSL certificates) and clear privacy policy links are displayed. In addition, e-commerce forms should allow users to quickly enter address information to avoid making users feel cumbersome. Education website: The Webform design of an education website needs to collect users’ personal information, learning interests, etc. In order to ensure that users can fill in the form smoothly, the form should have clear segmentation to avoid requiring too much information to be filled in at one time. Multi-step forms and progress bars are common design methods that help increase users’ motivation to fill in the form and avoid their resistance to long forms. Financial Industry: In the financial industry, the design of Webform must not only consider the accuracy of information collection, but also ensure the security of data. Users need to feel that their personal and financial data is strictly protected when filling out forms. Therefore, the design of Webform in the financial industry must show clear security measures, such as encryption technology signs, and provide clear privacy policies and data usage statements. Design differences caused by different Webform implementations Traditional HTML forms: Traditional HTML forms are usually simpler, and the fields are usually basic text boxes, drop-down boxes, etc. This design is suitable for simple forms that do not require complex interactions. However, the user experience of such forms may be poor, especially in terms of error prompts and data validation, which may require manual coding for processing. Dynamic Webform: With the development of technology, dynamic Webform (such as using AJAX, JavaScript and other technologies) has become a popular choice. Dynamic forms provide more interactivity, such as real-time validation, automatic filling, and field conditional display. This type of Webform can not only improve the user experience, but also increase the conversion rate of the form. Dynamic forms are usually more suitable for complex surveys or registration processes.

They have a simple structure and usually consist of text boxes, drop-down menus, radio buttons, and submit buttons. Such forms are easy to implement and highly compatible, and can be supported by almost all browsers. Advantages High compatibility: HTML forms can work properly on various devices and browsers, suitable for websites that need to maximize access. Low learning cost: Developers only need to master basic HTML and CSS knowledge to implement simple forms. Disadvantages Limited user experience: HTML forms lack interactivity and cannot provide real-time error prompts or dynamically display fields. Difficult to expand functions: To implement more advanced functions, such as field conditional display or data validation, additional JavaScript is required, which increases the complexity of development. Applicable scenarios Static pages: For example, a simple contact form, where users only need to enter their name and email. Resource-constrained projects: When the development team has limited time or a tight budget, HTML forms are a reliable choice. Example Early blogs and small personal websites often used HTML forms to collect visitor information, such as message boards.

When creating a domain name for a new website, we usually consider the following aspects: Brand building: A unique and memorable domain name can help enhance brand image and recognition. For example, a domain name like “amazon.com” is not only short and memorable, but also becomes synonymous with the brand. Long-term visibility: Domain name optimization has a greater long-term impact on the overall SEO of the website. A domain name with relevant keywords may slightly improve search rankings, but this is no longer as important as content and user experience in today’s search algorithms. User trust: Choosing authoritative top-level domains (such as “.com”, “.org”) is usually easier to gain user trust, while long domains or domains with hyphens may appear unprofessional.

Improve content relevance: The page name (usually reflected by the title tag and URL) should be highly consistent with the page content and user search intent. For example, the title of a landing page selling running shoes can be “Lightweight running shoes - designed for runners.” Increase click-through rate (CTR): Optimized page names can make users more likely to click in search results. Attractive titles not only contain keywords, but also convey value or emotion, such as “Quick weight loss tips - try these 5 methods.” Flexible use of keywords: Compared with domain names, page names can use long-tail keywords more freely, thereby more targeted to meet specific user needs. Understanding the difference between domain names and landing page names can help develop more precise SEO strategies. Domain name determines the whole picture: It has a profound impact on the brand positioning and user trust of the entire website, so it is more suitable to highlight the brand rather than stuff keywords. Page name affects single page optimization: It directly affects the ranking and click performance of a specific page, and can be more flexible in keyword combination and optimization. Both need to be optimized together: A SEO-optimized domain name plus a well-designed page name combination can significantly improve the search engine performance of the entire website.

These names not only meet the algorithm requirements of search engines, but also can highly match the user’s search intent, thereby increasing the visibility and conversion rate of the website.

In order for a domain name to meet SEO best practices, it generally needs to meet the following criteria: Include relevant keywords: Using keywords related to your business or target market in your domain name can help improve your site’s search engine rankings. For example, if your business is “digital marketing”, a domain name that includes “digitalmarketing” or “onlinemarketing” will help attract relevant search traffic. Notes: While keywords can provide certain SEO benefits, overusing keywords (such as “best-digital-marketing-services.com”) can make the domain name seem long and difficult to remember, so a careful balance needs to be struck. Simple and memorable: Simple, clear domain names are easier for users to remember and type into a browser. Avoid using long, complex or misspelled words to ensure that the domain name is easy to spread. Positive examples: google.com: A short, easy-to-spell, and globally recognizable domain name that users can easily remember and access directly. apple.com: A simple and branded domain name that is highly recognizable and requires little additional promotion to gain widespread user memory. Bad examples: best-seo-tips-for-your-website.com: Although it contains keywords, this domain name is very long and complex, difficult to remember, and not easy to type. Search engines may also consider this as a sign of over-optimization, which may affect the SEO effect of the website. buycheapsneakersandfootwearonline4u.com: Such a domain name is not only long, but also difficult to remember. If a user wants to visit this website, they need to spend extra time typing this domain name, which is not good for the long-term development of the brand. Avoid hyphens and numbers: Hyphens (such as “-”) and numbers usually make the domain name more complicated, which is not conducive to user memory and dissemination. Search engines also tend to give priority to domain names without hyphens, so it is recommended to avoid such characters as much as possible. Choose the right top-level domain name (TLD): Top-level domain names (such as .com, .org, .net, etc.) are an important factor affecting user trust. Although different TLDs have less impact on SEO, .com is generally considered more reliable and has global recognition.

To ensure that landing page names meet SEO requirements, the following standards need to be followed: Include target keywords: The page title and URL should try to include keywords that users may use when searching. This not only helps the page’s search engine ranking, but also ensures that the page matches the user’s search intent and improves the relevance of the page. For example, if your page is about “SEO Optimization Services”, the title should include “SEO Optimization Services” and the URL can be www.example.com/seo-optimization-services, which will help search engines identify the topic of the page. Attractiveness of title tags and descriptions: The title tag is the first thing that search engines read and is also the text displayed in search results. A clear and attractive title can significantly increase the click-through rate (CTR) of the page. At the same time, the title should not be too long, and it is generally recommended to be controlled within 50-60 characters so that it can be fully displayed in search results. Simple URL structure: Similar to page titles, URLs should be as concise and descriptive as possible. Ideally, URL structures should include target keywords and avoid using long numbers or meaningless parameters. For example, www.example.com/seo-tips is more SEO-friendly than www.example.com/page/1234. Highly consistent with content: Page names need to be highly consistent with the content of the page, and avoid using names that are irrelevant or inaccurate to the content. This not only helps search engines accurately index pages, but also improves user experience and engagement, and reduces bounce rates.

Avoid over-optimization: Although including keywords is a necessary condition for SEO, excessive keyword stacking (such as “best-seo-tips-for-your-website.com”) may be judged as keyword stacking by search engines, thus affecting rankings.

Provides price information for each domain name to help users make purchasing decisions quickly.

Cons: The generated domain name suggestions are usually simple and sometimes not very creative. The analysis of SEO is relatively basic and cannot provide traffic data or competition analysis.

Page Title Optimization Tools These tools focus on generating efficient, SEO-friendly titles and URLs for landing pages (i.e. specific pages) to help improve page click-through rates and search engine rankings. Page name generation tools usually combine SEO data to determine the attractiveness and optimization effect of the title. 1.

Tacit knowledge, also known as implicit knowledge, is a type of knowledge that is difficult to formalize and personal, usually based on experience, intuition, and perception. Unlike explicit knowledge, tacit knowledge is difficult to convey through words, data, or formulas. It is often deeply embedded in an individual’s behavior, skills, or culture, and relies on practice and personal experience to acquire. For example, learning to ride a bicycle is a typical example of tacit knowledge. Although you can describe in words how to hold the handlebars, keep your balance, and pedal, these instructions cannot really convey how to keep your balance during actual riding. Only through repeated practice will you “understand” how to ride freely at a certain moment.

This type of knowledge often involves personal unique experience, technical know-how, intuition, etc., and is usually kept in the individual’s mind or in a restrictive environment within the organization. Explicit private knowledge: This knowledge is explicit but is limited to individuals or small groups. It can be recorded, but it is usually not disclosed to the outside world, perhaps because of company secrets, proprietary technology or personal privacy. Example: A company’s R\u0026D plan or strategic documents, although documented, can only be circulated within the company due to confidentiality measures and cannot be obtained by the outside world. Implicit private knowledge: This type of knowledge is typical implicit knowledge, usually rooted in personal experience, technology or intuition, difficult to express through language or written form, and only belongs to an individual or a few people.

The competitive advantage it brings is more lasting, especially in professional fields. Limitations: Private tacit knowledge is difficult to transfer and share, which means it can only be spread within individuals or a small range and is difficult to scale. In addition, this knowledge may be lost as the holders leave (such as retirement or resignation). Private explicit knowledge This kind of knowledge is also of high value because it is explicit but still private and is usually only spread within a limited circle, such as internal corporate documents, proprietary technology, or patent-protected innovations. It is highly protective and can be regulated and applied. Limitations: Although explicit knowledge is easier to transfer, its proprietary value will decrease once it is made public or leaked. Therefore, companies need to protect this knowledge through legal means (such as intellectual property rights). Public tacit knowledge This type of knowledge is relatively valuable because, although it is implicit, it can still be shared through a certain socialization process, usually transmitted in the form of practice, interaction, or experience, such as a common craft or interpersonal interaction skills in an industry. Limitations: Since the transmission of tacit knowledge requires interaction and practice, it cannot be popularized on a large scale and requires time and practice accumulation to master, so the speed of dissemination is slow. Public explicit knowledge The lowest value, because this type of knowledge is open to everyone and can be easily obtained (such as textbooks, public patents, academic papers). Due to its popularity, its competitive value in the market is low. Limitations: Public explicit knowledge lacks uniqueness due to its universality and is difficult to provide competitive advantages. In addition, the decontextualization of knowledge may not fully meet specific needs in practical applications, and it needs to be combined with practical experience and context to be effectively applied.

SECI represents four modes of knowledge conversion, namely: Socialization, Externalization, Combination, Internalization. These processes describe the mutual transformation between implicit knowledge and explicit knowledge. Socialization – From implicit knowledge to explicit knowledge Socialization is the process of transferring implicit knowledge through interaction or observation. For example, in a master-apprentice relationship, the apprentice acquires skills by observing the actual operation of the master, similar to the knowledge acquired through practice and shared experience. This process is usually not dependent on language, but is achieved through joint action and sharing of experience. Example: New employees gradually master some operational skills that are difficult to describe in writing by working with old employees and observing how they solve problems. Externalization – From implicit knowledge to explicit knowledge Externalization is the process of converting implicit knowledge into explicit knowledge, usually through discussion, analogy, model and other means to formalize the experience, intuition or skills that are difficult for individuals to express into documents or theories. This is a key step in knowledge creation, because implicit knowledge can only be more widely disseminated after it becomes explicit knowledge. Example: An experienced technician passes on his years of implicit experience to other members of the team by writing technical documents or tutorials. Combination – From explicit knowledge to explicit knowledge Combination is the process of organizing and recombining different explicit knowledge to create new explicit knowledge. Through the integration and analysis of information, a new knowledge framework is established and disseminated through reports, databases, etc. Example: An organization collects research results from different departments, summarizes them and forms a new strategic plan or product development plan. Internalization – From explicit knowledge to implicit knowledge Internalization is to transform explicit knowledge into individual implicit knowledge by learning and practicing it. This step is similar to “experiential learning”, that is, individuals form their own understanding and experience through the practice of explicit knowledge, which becomes potential implicit knowledge. Example: Employees learn the organization’s training manuals and apply what they have learned in actual work, eventually forming their own operating methods and skills.

In an organization, this conversion process can promote knowledge creation and innovation. When implicit knowledge is passed on to others through socialization and externalized into explicit knowledge, and explicit knowledge is further absorbed through combination and internalization, new implicit and explicit knowledge can be generated. This knowledge conversion is the core of organizational knowledge management, especially in innovative enterprises, by effectively utilizing employees’ implicit knowledge and converting it into explicit knowledge, it can bring continuous innovation and competitive advantages to the company. The SECI model can be visualized as a spiraling knowledge creation process, and the continuous conversion from implicit knowledge to explicit knowledge promotes the accumulation and development of knowledge.

Imagine your target audience searching for information related to your products or services online, and your brand appears prominently in the search results – this would undoubtedly significantly increase the chances of users clicking on your website. SEM primarily operates through search engine advertising platforms, such as Google Ads or Microsoft Advertising. Businesses bid on specific keywords to ensure their ads are displayed in relevant searches. When users search for these keywords, they see the ads you’ve bid on.

Labor and Execution Costs: The Most Underestimated Item Even with ample ad budget, without professional personnel or the time to manage the account, it’s difficult to achieve ideal ad results. Self-management means you or your team members are responsible for: Setting up ad structure and deployment logic (campaigns, ad groups, match types, etc.). Writing ad copy that matches keyword intent. Daily/weekly data review, performance analysis, budget, and bid adjustments. Deploying and testing conversion tracking codes. Making strategic judgments: what to pause, what to boost, what to test. If a business founder or marketing head personally manages operations, it means a significant amount of core time will be consumed, thereby affecting investment in other core business activities. If an internal employee is tasked with execution, there might be training or recruitment costs involved. Some companies also choose to hire part-time ad consultants to assist with account management, billed hourly or per project. Overall, managing SEM ads in-house is suitable for businesses that want to control their budget and possess a certain level of execution and analytical ability. However, this requires the business to be able to handle the pressure of learning, operating, and adjusting, and to be accountable for the final results.

Budget \u003c $1,000/month: Suggest doing it yourself or hiring a freelancer. Budget between $2,000–$10,000/month: Consider an experienced freelancer or a small to medium-sized agency. Budget \u003e $10,000/month: Recommend a mature agency, demanding comprehensive strategy and performance tracking. Do you have internal resources to manage ads? Someone knowledgeable in ad operations: You can run ads yourself + purchase tools. No relevant internal staff: A freelancer or agency is more suitable. Do you prioritize “cost control” or “quick results”? Want to maintain control and explore gradually: Self-management or a freelancer offers more flexibility. Want quick results and to save effort: An agency is more efficient but also costs more. Dimension Self-Managed (In-house) Hire a Freelancer Hire an Agency Suitable Business Stage Startup, limited budget Startup/early growth, tight resources Growth stage, expansion, stable budget Budget Flexibility High Medium-High Low (most require a minimum budget threshold) Internal Resource Requirements High (needs ad knowledge or willingness to learn) Medium (needs some communication/cooperation ability) Low (expect agency to handle entirely after handover) Ad Performance Control High (all operations controlled by yourself) Medium (can collaborate deeply) Low (primarily relies on agency’s professional judgment) Technical/Strategic Level Depends on self-learning ability Depends on individual, varying capabilities Relatively professional and stable, standardized processes Communication Cost Lowest Medium (depends on individual) High (involves liaison, reporting mechanisms) Scalability Bottlenecked (labor limits) Limited (one person led) Strong (can quickly cover multiple channels/services) A final reminder: How well your ads perform isn’t just about how much you spend, but whether you’re spending it the right way. Regardless of the ad placement method you choose, it’s recommended to prepare the following before starting: Clarify your goals (exposure? leads? conversions?): This is the starting point for all strategies. Estimate your investment budget and duration: Consider a testing budget and a formal deployment budget, and set a reasonable campaign period. Understand basic ad metrics and evaluation criteria: Familiarize yourself with “The Ultimate Guide to SEM Data Analysis” to assess performance. Research and compare potential partners (freelancer or agency), and clearly define service boundaries in contracts to avoid unnecessary misunderstandings and “budget surprises.” Plan your data monitoring and reporting mechanisms: Regardless of who runs the ads, transparent data feedback is crucial.

A better approach is to continue the value proposition emphasized in the ad on the landing page’s first screen: Headline: “Save 2 Hours a Day, Experience TimeFlow Now” Sub-headline: “Auto-syncs schedules, seamless collaboration, for busy professionals” First screen button: “Free Trial, No Credit Card Required” The landing page shouldn’t make users re-understand or re-evaluate. Instead, it should flow from their interest and intent, continuing the core promise of the ad.

Visual and Structural Consistency: Maintaining User Sensory Continuity An ad brings not just a click, but also an anticipated experience. If a user jumps from a clean, minimalist ad visual to a cluttered, information-dense landing page, they’ll feel “this isn’t where I just clicked from,” which reduces trust. Elements that should remain consistent include: Color scheme and typography: If the ad has a clean blue, white, and gray style, the landing page shouldn’t switch to a brand poster-like design. Tone of voice: If the ad copy is concise and rational, the landing page shouldn’t become emotional or overly playful. Call-to-action placement: If the ad emphasizes “free trial,” the main action button on the landing page should be prominently placed on the first screen, and the text should be identical.

Here’s how TimeFlow’s example would match: Primary Call to Action in Ad Matching Strategy on Landing Page Common Problem Examples Free Trial First-screen button: “Start Free Trial Now,” leads to pop-up registration upon click No button on first screen, or vague button text Get Pricing Prominent pricing form entry, title: “Get Pricing Plan” Redirects to irrelevant page after form submission Schedule Demo Form title: “Schedule Product Demo,” concise form fields Form located too deep, or tedious fields A consistent action path reduces user hesitation and increases the likelihood of completing a conversion.

Quality Score is made up of three main factors: Expected Click-Through Rate (CTR) Ad Relevance Landing Page Experience The latter two are directly related to consistency. If there’s a lack of coherence between the ad copy, keywords, and landing page, the system will deem it a “poor experience,” thereby lowering the score.

Ad Relevance: How closely your ad copy relates to your keywords. Landing Page Experience: The relevance of your landing page to your ad and keywords, user-friendliness, loading speed, etc. Why is it important? A high Quality Score means your ad is more likely to get a higher ad rank at a lower Cost Per Click (CPC). Simply put, it helps you get better ad positions for less money.

In the Bot Store, you can see official Coze bots as well as bots published by other users. in addition, if you choose to shelve a bot that you have created yourself, it will also appear in the store. Plugin Store: You can see official and other user released plugins, such as GPT4V, Google Web Search, DALLE 3, etc. You can sort them by “Most Popular” or “Most Recent”. Workflow Store: A “workflow” is an organized series of steps to accomplish a task. For a complex task, we need to disassemble it into individual steps, and then connect each step according to a preset process and action, so as to automate the task and reduce the repetitive operations of manual labor. In the Workflow Store, you can view and copy workflows that others have already created. You can also choose to create a workflow yourself and apply it in your Bot.

Create a bot and complete the basic settings Click “Create Bot” in the upper left corner, and then complete the following basic settings: Space (required): choose the space where the bot will be stored, either “Personal Space” or “Team Space”. Bot name (required): we set it to “English - Chinese Translator”. User message bill (required): choose whether the user should pay for the message usage during the conversation or you should pay for it yourself. Bot functionality profile (optional): describes what your Bot does. This will be presented to the user who uses your Bot. Icon (required): you can upload an image directly, or ask Coze to generate a suitable icon based on your Bot’s name and function. Once you have completed the above settings, you can click the “Confirm” button to proceed to the next step. Here is a brief introduction of Coze’s charges for Message Credits: Coze charges according to the number of messages received while talking to a Bot, and the message credits are used to offset the cost of message usage while talking to a Bot (note that the number of replies received from a Bot while debugging the Bot will also deduct the corresponding credits). Each account will receive 10 free points per day. After the points have been deducted, you will receive a notification that you do not have enough points when you talk to the Bot. To continue talking to the Bot, you can purchase the Premium Plan, or buy more points individually. The cost varies depending on the model the Bot is using: Model Credits consumed per message GPT-3.5 Turbo 0.1 GPT-4o mini (128k) Coze free plan：0.1\\n Coze Premium：1 GPT-4o (8k) 2 GPT-4o (32k) 5 GPT-4o (128k) 10 Gemini 1.5 Pro 2.5 Gemini 1.5 Flash 0.5 Claude 3 Haiku 0.1 Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2 ","date":"2024-09-01","objectID":"/posts/how-to-create-bot-on-coze/:3:1","tags":["AI","Coze"],"title":"Step by step guide - How to Create Bot on Coze","uri":"/posts/how-to-create-bot-on-coze/"},{"categories":["AI"],"content":"2.

If you’ve ever stumbled upon a file with the .zst extension and wondered what kind of sorcery it is—don’t worry, you’re not alone. A ZST file is a compressed file format created using Zstandard (often shortened to zstd), a modern compression algorithm developed by Facebook. Think of it as the younger, faster cousin of more familiar formats like .zip or .gz. What makes .zst files special is their impressive balance between speed and compression ratio—they compress data quickly and decompress even faster, which is great for performance-critical applications. Zstandard is also highly tunable. You can dial up the compression level if you’re chasing a smaller file size, or ease it back if speed is more important. That flexibility has made it popular in everything from system package distributions (like Arch Linux or Fedora) to game asset compression.

As the value of k increases, the size of each cluster generally decreases, and therefore the distance of each point to its cluster center decreases, resulting in a decrease in SSE. Find the “elbow point”: Ideally, we want to find a small k value while keeping the SSE relatively small. When we plot the SSE corresponding to different k values, as the k value increases, the decline rate of SSE will slow down, and the curve will show an “elbow” shape. This “elbow point” is often considered the optimal number of clusters, as adding more clusters after this point does not significantly improve model fit (i.e., decrease in SSE) Taking into account the impact of random initialization: The KMeans algorithm randomly selects k clustering centers at the beginning, which may cause the algorithm results to be affected by the initial selection, making the final clustering result somewhat random. In order to obtain consistent results across multiple runs or different environments, we can set a random state. Here, by setting random_state=123, we ensure that the initial random selection of cluster centers is the same every time we run KMeans, making the results reproducible.

Increase in cluster centers: When we increase the number of clusters k, it means that more cluster centers can be used to represent data points. As the number of cluster centers increases, each data point is more likely to be assigned to a cluster center that is closer to it, so the average distance of each point to its cluster center will decrease, resulting in lower SSE. Decrease in cluster size: As the k value increases, the number of data points contained in each cluster usually decreases. Smaller clusters make data points within the cluster closer, reducing the distance between data points and their cluster centers, further reducing SSE. Extreme cases: In extreme cases, if the value of k is equal to the total number of data points, then each data point is its own cluster center, and the SSE will be 0. But this situation has no actual clustering significance and just illustrates why SSE will continue to decrease as k increases. #Use the KMeans clustering algorithm and specify the maximum number of clusters to test as 10 #KElbowVisualizer will evaluate k values from 1 to 10 to decide which k value is the best choice #Call the fit method to train the KMeans model elbow = KElbowVisualizer(KMeans(random_state=123), k=10) elbow.fit(df_final_scaled) elbow.show() The result of the run is a graph of different k values (number of clusters) and the corresponding SSE (sum of squared errors). The purpose of the elbow plot is to help us visually see how the SSE changes as the value of k increases. Ideally, SSE decreases as the k value increases, but the rate of decrease will slow down significantly at a certain point. This point is the so-called “elbow point” and is considered the optimal number of clusters. As can be seen from the figure, the “elbow point” is k=5 #Based on the results in the above figure, create a clustering object and set the number of clusters to 5. That is, the ultimate goal is to divide the data points into 8 clusters. model = KMeans(n_clusters=5, random_state=123) #fit_predict uses the preprocessed and standardized data set to train (fit) the KMeans model and returns the cluster labels assigned to each data point.

View Width: The shape of the violin plot can reveal the characteristics of the data distribution. For example, if the violin plot is particularly wide at one end, it indicates that the data points are denser around that value.

It can be regarded as a smoothed version of the histogram. Through the KDE chart, we can intuitively understand the distribution of data, including the central tendency, dispersion and skewness of the data. Here are a few key points on how to interpret kernel density estimation plots: Peaks: The peaks on the KDE chart represent the mode area in the data, that is, there are more data points near this value. There can be multiple peaks on a plot, indicating that the data distribution may be multimodal (i.e., there are multiple modes). Width: The width of the graph reflects the variability or dispersion of the data. A kernel density plot with a larger width indicates that the data points are more dispersed; conversely, a plot with a narrower width indicates that the data points are more concentrated. Skewness: If the KDE plot is not completely symmetrical, the data distribution may be skewed. If the graph extends longer to the right, the data is positively skewed (right-skewed), that is, more data values are to the left of the mean; if the graph extends longer to the left, the data is negatively skewed (left-skewed), That is, more data values are to the right of the mean. Tails: The tail of the KDE plot can tell us the tail behavior of the data distribution, such as whether there is a long tail or extreme values. A long tail is when one end of the graph extends very far, indicating that there are some extreme high or low values. Overlay Plot: Sometimes, researchers will draw multiple KDE plots on the same graph to compare the data distribution of different subsets. At this time, you can understand the distribution differences between different subsets by observing which areas overlap more and the shape differences of each graph. Kernel density estimation and actual data: It should be noted that the kernel density estimation graph represents an estimate of the data distribution, not the actual data distribution. Therefore, it is useful for revealing overall trends in the data, but may not be suitable for precise statistical testing.

Correlation Positive correlation: If an increase in one variable is accompanied by an increase in the other variable, then there is a positive correlation between the two variables. In a scatter plot, this appears as a general trend of the set of points from lower left to upper right. Negative correlation: If an increase in one variable is accompanied by a decrease in the other variable, then there is a negative correlation between the two variables. In a scatter plot, this appears as a general trend of the set of points from upper left to lower right. No correlation: If there is no obvious linear relationship between the two variables, the point set is relatively evenly distributed on the graph and there is no obvious trend. Clusters The points on a scatter plot sometimes form one or more clusters, indicating the presence of distinct subgroups in the data. These clusters may represent different categories, groups, or data points with similar characteristics. Outliers In a scatter plot, points that are far away from other data points are called outliers. These points may represent data entry errors, measurement errors, or actual data distribution properties. Trend Line Sometimes a trend line (such as a linear regression line) is added to a scatter plot to more clearly show the main trend between variables. The slope and direction of a trend line provide a visual representation of the relationship between variables. Distribution density In some scatter plots, the density of points reflects the concentration of data in that area. Areas with denser points indicate that there are more data points there.

The key to offline conversion tracking lies in “behavior matching”—connecting a user’s online activity to their offline conversions. Two common methods exist: Method 1: Through Ad Click IDs (e.g., GCLID, FBCID) When a user clicks an ad, the platform generates a unique ID attached to the landing page URL. Businesses must save this ID when the user submits a form or enters the CRM. If the user later converts, uploading this ID and conversion data to the ad platform completes the offline attribution. Method 2: Through User Identity Matching (e.g., phone number, email) If ad click IDs aren’t captured, conversions can still be matched by uploading customer details (e.g., phone numbers, emails, names). Platforms use encrypted data for fuzzy matching, linking conversions to past ad exposures.

I have pushed new products, been in charge of high net worth products, experienced the whole account being blocked, and recently started to learn to recruit competent subordinates. Although the market situation is not optimistic in these years, from my personal experience, from the perspective of salary and market demand, overseas advertising specialist is still a good career choice.

In most cases, yes. Generally companies with overseas advertising specialist positions have the need to go overseas, so foreign language skills are a certain ability that will be assessed. Usually the requirement is at least IELTS 7 level (if you have relevant experience, you may be able to relax the requirement), some of the more demanding companies will ask you the specific grade 6 score, if it is just over the passing line, it may also be seen as a minus. For students majoring in minor languages, minor languages will be a plus for you, but you must also pass the English level. Will Google Ad Specialist be very busy? Do you need to work overtime a lot? If anyone has probably understood the position of overseas advertising specialist, they may have seen a lot of practitioners are discouraged to quit, citing “very serious overtime”, “no personal time”, “need to keep an eye on the account on holidays \" and so on. It must be admitted that overtime is a relatively common situation for this position, but it cannot be generalized. According to my own situation and the situation of related practitioners around me, whether overtime and the intensity of overtime will be affected by the following two factors: Party A \u0026 B Company There is also a distinction between A and B party companies for overseas advertising. Party A refers to companies that have self-developed products (games, software, physical products, etc.), and then hire specialized personnel to be responsible for overseas advertising of these products. A B-side company is a company that provides advertising management or consulting services for the A-side company, usually called an agency (advertising agency) in the industry. In the vast majority of cases, the overtime of Party B staff will be much more serious. Because Party A staff is responsible for the entire company’s product advertising accounts, while Party B staff usually have at least five clients’ advertising accounts on hand, each client needs to promote a different number of products. I learned that one of the scarier figures is that there is an optimizer in Baidu who had more than 100 accounts in his hands. So, obviously, don’t go to a B-side company if you can find an A-side job. When screening jobs and companies, it is actually easy to see whether the job belongs to the A-side or B-side. In the job postings appear similar to the words “advertiser”, “advertisers”, is basically the position of the second party company. Promoted product types The more common types of products are: games, software, physical products (such as clothing, shoes and socks, accessories, etc.). For software and physical products, there will also be a distinction between C- and B-sides. Generally speaking, the overtime intensity is as follows (look at toB or toC first, then product type) C-side \u003e B-side Game \u003e physical product (partial e-commerce) \u003e software (non-game type) The size and magnitude of change of advertising traffic and the degree of market competition determine the frequency and intensity of your overtime. In addition, by the way, the overtime intensity of Google ad specialists is usually not as strong as that of Facebook ad specialists, because the algorithm mechanism of the two platforms is different, the latter has higher requirements for data continuity, and due to the existence of time differences, it usually requires the specialists to get up in the middle of the night to see if the account is abnormal. Is the Google Ad Specialist only responsible for Google channels? Can the experience be applied to other platforms? Google Ads specialists are usually only responsible for Google channels, but some smaller companies may have one specialist responsible for multiple channels (e.g. Facebook, Tiktok, Instagram, etc.). Regarding whether the experience can be reused, it needs to be judged according to different platform placement and algorithm mec","date":"2023-01-26","objectID":"/posts/what-does-a-google-ads-specialist-do/:2:0","tags":["SEM","Google Ads","Digital Marketing"],"title":"What does a Google Ads Specialist do?","uri":"/posts/what-does-a-google-ads-specialist-do/"},{"categories":["SEM","Digital Marketing"],"content":"Job Description The daily work of Google Ads Specialist includes the following.
