Bing Shopping Ads are product catalog-based advertisements within Microsoft’s advertising platform. They dynamically display product images, prices, and names to directly engage users with commercial intent. Key Differences from Traditional Search Ads: No Keyword Bidding: Ads are automatically matched to user search terms based on product attributes (titles, descriptions, categories). Visual Presentation: Image-centric formats (similar to e-commerce platforms) enhance click-through rates. Common Ad Placements: Product carousels at the top of Bing search results (labeled “Sponsored”). Microsoft partner platforms (e.g., Yahoo Shopping, AOL search results). Operational Mechanism Data Source: Microsoft Merchant Center Advertisers must create a product feed (including titles, descriptions, prices, stock status, image links) in Microsoft Merchant Center. Feeds undergo strict validation (e.g., price consistency with official websites, images ≥800×800 pixels). Ad Trigger Logic Search Term Matching: User queries (e.g., “men’s sneakers”) are linked to product titles/categories. Contextual Expansion: Ads may appear for semantically related terms (e.g., showing sneaker ads for “gym outfit ideas”). Ad Delivery \u0026 Conversion Tracking Users are redirected to advertiser websites upon clicking ads. Microsoft Advertising UET tags track conversions, ROAS (return on ad spend), and other KPIs.

Visual subjects are formed through combination or deformation. Low Detail Processing Reduce textures and decorative details on model surfaces, retaining only essential contour features to emphasize clean overall forms. Soft Color Schemes Predominantly use low-saturation tones (e.g., Morandi color palette) with gentle light-dark contrasts, avoiding high contrast or fluorescent colors. Highly Simplified Elements Retain only core visual information in compositions, eliminating redundant backgrounds or decorative elements. Use negative space to enhance subject focus. Abstract Representation Weaken realistic object forms through proportional adjustments or symbolic designs, such as using simplified cloud outlines instead of detailed depictions. Lightweight Textures Employ matte or translucent material effects, avoiding complex light reflections. Use basic highlights to suggest metallic/glass elements. Flattened Spatial Sense Minimize perspective depth through parallel viewing angles or mild axonometric projection, reducing scene layering. Function-Oriented Design Serve information delivery or interface interaction needs, emphasizing visual symbols' readability and quick recognition over pure decoration.

Hugo prioritizes templates in the root layouts/ directory. If baseof.html doesn’t exist there, copy it from the theme directory first. Does Disabling Text Selection Affect SEO? No direct impact. Search engine crawlers (e.g., Google Bot) primarily parse HTML source code rather than being restricted by CSS styles. The user-select: none property only prevents mouse-based text selection by users. Text remains visible in the HTML source, fully accessible to crawlers. Search engines ignore most CSS styles (except techniques like display: none or visibility: hidden), so user-select: none won’t affect crawling or indexing.

Support fast iteration: because it is a customized page, it has high flexibility in adjusting content and design, and will not affect other businesses. Easy data analysis: the overall CTA logic of the page is basically consistent, the number of user paths is small, and only a small number of channels use this page, which is convenient for subsequent analysis of data effects. Disadvantages: Requires additional design and development costs. Weak brand credibility: Users may want to know more about the website, but dedicated landing pages generally do not provide an obvious entrance to other pages.

Keep the top navigation bar: Users can understand the general structure of the website through the navigation bar and freely jump to the page they are interested in. Advantages: Cost savings: No additional design and development involved. Strengthen brand consistency: Ensure the overall experience of users on the official website, and at the same time have user comments, third-party evaluation certificates and other pages as support for brand credibility. Disadvantages: Relatively low conversion rate: The official website content is more brand-oriented, and the information is not focused enough. Users are easily distracted by other content such as navigation bars and internal links. Difficult to iterate quickly and data is mixed: Different channels will use official website pages, and content and design adjustments require the consent of multiple parties before they can be promoted. The multiple behavioral paths of users on the website also increase the difficulty of data analysis. As for which form or website structure is better, it still depends on the brand’s own focus and marketing strategy. Take the landing page of monday.com as an example: it is not difficult to find that monday.com uses the official website homepage (https://monday.com/) to accept users who search for its brand words, and uses dedicated landing pages (such as https://monday.com/ap/project-management) to meet users who search for other keywords (here I use project management).

Ambiguous Geographic Intent: Handling vague descriptions (e.g., “coffee shops nearby”) by combining real-time user location (via IP address or device GPS) or search history to infer the specific range. Multilingual/Multi-Region Adaptation: For example, when a user searches for “München,” it may cater to German-speaking users or those in Germany, automatically associating it with “Munich.” Geolocation and Personalized Ranking IP Address and Device Location: Prioritizing local results for the user’s region (e.g., searching “weather” directly displays forecasts for the current location). Regionalized Ranking Strategies: The same query yields different results in different regions (e.g., “food delivery platform” shows DoorDash in New York and Demae-can in Tokyo). Multi-Location Intent: Users may explicitly specify non-local regions (e.g., a Beijing user searching for “Shanghai travel guide”), requiring intent differentiation.

Addresses, phone area codes, or administrative division names in the page text. Implicit Geographic Associations: Localized content (e.g., “Sydney Opera House transportation guide” implies relevance to Sydney). Regional phrases or cultural references (e.g., “National Day Golden Week” targets Chinese users). Technical Signals: Server location (a secondary reference, though CDNs may weaken this signal). Country-code top-level domains (e.g., .de, .jp) or subdirectories (e.g., example.com/de/). Geographic Relevance Evaluation and Indexing Regionalized Indexing: Pages are categorized and stored by geographic relevance (e.g., “Japan travel” pages are filed under the Asia index partition). Local SEO Weighting: Google My Business profile completeness, local backlinks (e.g., citations from regional media). Density of local keywords on the page (e.g., repeated mentions of “San Francisco Bay Area remodeling company”). Multi-Region Targeting: Use hreflang tags to differentiate language/region versions.

The core competition in digital marketing has shifted from “acquiring traffic” to “screening high-quality users.” With rising traffic costs and increasingly complex user behavior, blindly pursuing user quantity leads to resource waste: Low-quality users may generate short-term clicks but fail to deliver long-term returns (e.g., fake clicks, coupon abuse). By evaluating user quality, businesses can precisely identify high-value segments, allocate budgets to conversion-ready users, and avoid ineffective spending. The essence of user quality assessment lies in identifying real value through cohort analysis. Traditional traffic metrics often obscure user heterogeneity - users acquired during the same period may generate vastly different value due to channel sources, motivations, and behavioral patterns.

from Non-Cohort? If we compare user behavior analysis to marathon analytics: Cohort Analysis tracks the same group of runners throughout the race (e.g., “What percentage of users who joined in March completed the marathon?\") Non-Cohort Analysis captures real-time snapshots of all runners (e.g., “Current number of participants on the track”) An e-commerce platform made a critical error by using non-cohort analysis to observe a “15% increase in click-through rate on the redesigned page” and immediately rolled it out globally. Three months later, core user repurchase rates plummeted by 20% - the new design attracted transient clickers while confusing loyal users who couldn’t find essential functions. This “illusion of averages” exemplifies the disaster caused by conflating analytical methods. It’s caused by divergent temporal perspectives: When to Use Cohort Analysis: Tracking behavioral evolution over time (e.g., 3-month retention rates for new users) Assessing long-term impacts of product changes Analyzing time-dependent behavioral patterns When to Use Non-Cohort Analysis: Real-time status monitoring (e.g., current ad campaign performance) Hourly promotional conversion tracking Immediate anomaly detection Strategic decisions require integrated application of both methods.

This information can be simple contact information, questionnaire answers, or complex orders or application content. Through Webform, the website can establish a two-way connection with the visitor, thereby achieving the goal of information collection, conversion or interaction. Common types of Webform and corresponding examples There are many types of Webform. The following are several common types and practical application examples: Registration form Used for users to create an account or subscribe to a service, usually including fields such as name, email address, and password. For example, the registration form of LinkedIn allows users to quickly join the platform and get professional content and connections. Contact form It is used for users to contact the company directly, suitable for support, feedback or consultation needs. For example, Apple’s support page provides a simple contact form to help users quickly submit technical questions or inquire about services. Survey form It is used for market research or collecting user feedback, usually including multiple choice and open-ended questions. SurveyMonkey’s survey form is widely used for user satisfaction surveys and product feedback collection. Payment form It is used to enter payment information when shopping online, usually combined with a payment gateway. For example, the payment form provided by Shopify allows merchants and consumers to complete the entire process of order payment. Event registration form It is used to collect registration for conferences, webinars or training. Forms like Eventbrite allow users to quickly register and attend upcoming events. The role of Webforms Webforms are not only interactive tools on websites, but also an important means to promote business goals. With Webforms, companies can interact with customers more efficiently and increase conversion opportunities. Specific functions include: Data collection and analysis Webforms are an efficient way to collect user information. Whether it is basic user information such as name and email address, or deeper personal needs, preferences and behavior data, they can be quickly collected through forms. For example, Airbnb uses booking forms to collect accommodation needs from potential customers and help them customize personalized recommendations. Drive user conversion Optimally designed Webforms can reduce the barriers for users to fill out forms, thereby increasing submission rates. Simple forms and clear calls to action (such as “Register now” or “Get a quote”) can effectively increase user action intentions and thus increase conversion rates. For example, Dropbox has effectively reduced user churn by simplifying its registration form, requiring only email and password. Enhance user trust and experience A well-designed Webform can enhance the professionalism and user experience of the website and help build user trust. The form needs to be easy to understand, with clear error prompts and avoid complicated steps. For example, Zappos’s form design focuses on user comfort, providing clear field labels and friendly operation prompts, so that users feel that the filling process is smooth and unobstructed. Automated marketing and customer relationship management Webform is usually integrated with automation platforms such as customer relationship management (CRM) systems and email marketing tools, which can instantly transmit user information to the back-end system and trigger subsequent marketing actions. For example, Mailchimp’s subscription form can automatically store subscriber information in its system and send welcome emails and subsequent marketing content in real time. Improve the efficiency of interaction and feedback collection Through Webform, companies can easily collect customer feedback, comments and satisfaction surveys.

Whether you are designing a simple registration form or a complex questionnaire, it is important to follow some key design principles. By following these principles, you can not only ensure that users can fill out the form smoothly, but also increase their engagement. Here are some proven webform design best practices: Simplicity The first principle of form design is simplicity. As we all know, the simpler the better. Try to remove unnecessary fields to avoid making the form feel too cumbersome for users. Ideally, webforms should only require users to provide the most basic information - this can save users time and increase conversion rates. Every additional field is a potential abandonment point, especially for mobile users, entering long text is a big challenge. Clarity Every field in the form needs to be clear and easy to understand. Field labels should avoid industry jargon or vague wording as much as possible. It is crucial that users can quickly understand what to fill in. Clear labels can reduce users' cognitive load and avoid confusion during the filling process. More importantly, forms should help users understand why certain information is required and ensure they know how to fill it out through short and powerful instructions or prompts. Feedback mechanism Instant feedback is the key to improving user experience. Webforms should provide instant error prompts when users are typing. By highlighting the error field and providing concise and clear error messages, users can quickly find problems and correct them. This real-time feedback not only improves the effectiveness of the form, but also reduces user frustration and encourages them to continue filling out the form. Usability With the popularity of mobile devices, Webform design must adapt to various devices, especially on mobile and tablet devices. Forms should have responsive design and automatically adjust according to screen size to ensure that users can get a smooth experience whether they are filling out on desktop, tablet or mobile phone. Buttons should be large and easy to click, and form fields should be easy to enter to avoid user experience problems caused by small screens. Trust Users often have concerns when submitting sensitive information (such as personal information or payment data). Therefore, Webform design should strengthen the establishment of trust. By clearly displaying a privacy policy, encryption technology logo, or security certification, users will feel more comfortable submitting their information. Especially in industries such as finance and e-commerce, security and privacy are key factors in users' choice of whether to fill out a form. ","date":"2024-12-08","objectID":"/posts/best-landing-page-layouts-with-webform/:2:0","tags":["Landing Page","Digital Marketing","SEM"],"title":"Best Landing Page Layouts with Webform","uri":"/posts/best-landing-page-layouts-with-webform/"},{"categories":["Landing Page","Digital Marketing","SEM"],"content":"Adjust Webform design according to different types of websites While best design principles apply to all Webforms, different types of websites and industries have their own unique needs. Based on the best design principles, the design of Webforms should take into account the target audience, the business nature of the website, and specific functional requirements. Differences in Webform design for B-end and C-end websites B-end website (corporate website): B-end websites are usually aimed at corporate customers or professionals, and these users pay more attention to efficiency and functionality when filling out forms. Therefore, when designing B-end Webforms, the form usually contains more data fields, such as company name, position, industry, etc. At the same time, B-end users usually need more information to evaluate whether the product or service meets their needs, so the form should provide clear segmentation to avoid information overload. C-end website (consumer website): C-end websites are aimed at ordinary consumers, and users pay more attention to speed and convenience when filling out forms. In this case, the form design should be simplified as much as possible to reduce the number of steps to fill in. For example, many e-commerce websites use a single “register/login” field (such as email or mobile phone number) to avoid cumbersome steps and ensure that users complete the operation in the shortest time, thereby increasing conversion rates. Differences in Webform design in different industries E-commerce website: The Webform of an e-commerce website usually contains key content such as payment information and delivery address. In order to enhance the user’s purchase intention, special attention should be paid to the simplicity and security of the form when designing. For example, when users fill in payment information, the form should ensure that security signs (such as SSL certificates) and clear privacy policy links are displayed. In addition, e-commerce forms should allow users to quickly enter address information to avoid making users feel cumbersome. Education website: The Webform design of an education website needs to collect users' personal information, learning interests, etc. In order to ensure that users can fill in the form smoothly, the form should have clear segmentation to avoid requiring too much information to be filled in at one time. Multi-step forms and progress bars are common design methods that help increase users' motivation to fill in the form and avoid their resistance to long forms. Financial Industry: In the financial industry, the design of Webform must not only consider the accuracy of information collection, but also ensure the security of data. Users need to feel that their personal and financial data is strictly protected when filling out forms. Therefore, the design of Webform in the financial industry must show clear security measures, such as encryption technology signs, and provide clear privacy policies and data usage statements. Design differences caused by different Webform implementations Traditional HTML forms: Traditional HTML forms are usually simpler, and the fields are usually basic text boxes, drop-down boxes, etc. This design is suitable for simple forms that do not require complex interactions. However, the user experience of such forms may be poor, especially in terms of error prompts and data validation, which may require manual coding for processing. Dynamic Webform: With the development of technology, dynamic Webform (such as using AJAX, JavaScript and other technologies) has become a popular choice. Dynamic forms provide more interactivity, such as real-time validation, automatic filling, and field conditional display. This type of Webform can not only improve the user experience, but also increase the conversion rate of the form. Dynamic forms are usually more suitable for complex surveys or registration processes.

They have a simple structure and usually consist of text boxes, drop-down menus, radio buttons, and submit buttons. Such forms are easy to implement and highly compatible, and can be supported by almost all browsers. Advantages High compatibility: HTML forms can work properly on various devices and browsers, suitable for websites that need to maximize access. Low learning cost: Developers only need to master basic HTML and CSS knowledge to implement simple forms. Disadvantages Limited user experience: HTML forms lack interactivity and cannot provide real-time error prompts or dynamically display fields. Difficult to expand functions: To implement more advanced functions, such as field conditional display or data validation, additional JavaScript is required, which increases the complexity of development. Applicable scenarios Static pages: For example, a simple contact form, where users only need to enter their name and email. Resource-constrained projects: When the development team has limited time or a tight budget, HTML forms are a reliable choice. Example Early blogs and small personal websites often used HTML forms to collect visitor information, such as message boards. Although this form is simple, it may lead to poor user experience on mobile devices due to layout issues.

It allows the page to update the form content without refreshing the entire web page, providing a smoother user experience. Advantages High interactivity: Users can get instant feedback when filling out the form, such as error prompts or field auto-fill. Strong flexibility: Dynamic forms can dynamically adjust fields based on user input to provide a more personalized experience. For example, when a user selects a specific country, the form will automatically load the state or province options for that country. Disadvantages High development complexity: Implementing dynamic webforms requires familiarity with technologies such as JavaScript and AJAX. May affect performance: Overly complex dynamic effects may increase page loading time, especially on mobile devices. Applicable scenarios E-commerce websites: For example, in the checkout form of a shopping cart, it is very common to automatically fill in the address after the user enters the zip code. SaaS platform: Multi-step forms during registration or login often use dynamic methods, such as the step of verifying the email address. Example Stripe’s payment form is an example of a dynamic form. When users fill in their credit card information, the system automatically verifies the correctness of the card number and identifies the card type (Visa, MasterCard, etc.) based on the card number.

These tools usually provide a drag-and-drop design interface that allows users to create professional forms without writing code. Advantages Quick launch: Users can quickly create and embed forms without a complex development process. Advanced features: Many third-party tools provide analytical functions, conditional logic, automated workflows, etc., which can greatly improve the effectiveness of forms. Brand consistency: Some tools allow custom styles to keep the form consistent with the overall style of the website. Disadvantages Cost issues: Advanced features usually require a paid subscription, which may be a burden for teams with limited budgets. Highly dependent: If the tool provider stops supporting or the service is interrupted, the normal operation of the form may be affected. Applicable scenarios Marketing activities: When you need to quickly launch an activity page and collect potential customer information, the flexibility of third-party tools is unmatched. Data analysis needs: Scenarios that require detailed form submission data reports (such as conversion rate and user behavior analysis). Example Typeform is a very popular tool, and its intuitive interface and interactive form design have won the favor of many companies. For example, many startups use Typeform to create personalized questionnaires. When users fill in the form, the interface will guide them step by step. This smooth experience significantly increases the completion rate.

For example, a domain name like “amazon.com” is not only short and memorable, but also becomes synonymous with the brand. Long-term visibility: Domain name optimization has a greater long-term impact on the overall SEO of the website. A domain name with relevant keywords may slightly improve search rankings, but this is no longer as important as content and user experience in today’s search algorithms. User trust: Choosing authoritative top-level domains (such as “.com”, “.org”) is usually easier to gain user trust, while long domains or domains with hyphens may appear unprofessional.

Improve content relevance: The page name (usually reflected by the title tag and URL) should be highly consistent with the page content and user search intent. For example, the title of a landing page selling running shoes can be “Lightweight running shoes - designed for runners.” Increase click-through rate (CTR): Optimized page names can make users more likely to click in search results. Attractive titles not only contain keywords, but also convey value or emotion, such as “Quick weight loss tips - try these 5 methods.” Flexible use of keywords: Compared with domain names, page names can use long-tail keywords more freely, thereby more targeted to meet specific user needs. Understanding the difference between domain names and landing page names can help develop more precise SEO strategies. Domain name determines the whole picture: It has a profound impact on the brand positioning and user trust of the entire website, so it is more suitable to highlight the brand rather than stuff keywords. Page name affects single page optimization: It directly affects the ranking and click performance of a specific page, and can be more flexible in keyword combination and optimization. Both need to be optimized together: A SEO-optimized domain name plus a well-designed page name combination can significantly improve the search engine performance of the entire website.

In order for a domain name to meet SEO best practices, it generally needs to meet the following criteria: Include relevant keywords: Using keywords related to your business or target market in your domain name can help improve your site’s search engine rankings. For example, if your business is “digital marketing”, a domain name that includes “digitalmarketing” or “onlinemarketing” will help attract relevant search traffic. Notes: While keywords can provide certain SEO benefits, overusing keywords (such as “best-digital-marketing-services.com”) can make the domain name seem long and difficult to remember, so a careful balance needs to be struck. Simple and memorable: Simple, clear domain names are easier for users to remember and type into a browser. Avoid using long, complex or misspelled words to ensure that the domain name is easy to spread. Positive examples: google.com: A short, easy-to-spell, and globally recognizable domain name that users can easily remember and access directly. apple.com: A simple and branded domain name that is highly recognizable and requires little additional promotion to gain widespread user memory. Bad examples: best-seo-tips-for-your-website.com: Although it contains keywords, this domain name is very long and complex, difficult to remember, and not easy to type. Search engines may also consider this as a sign of over-optimization, which may affect the SEO effect of the website. buycheapsneakersandfootwearonline4u.com: Such a domain name is not only long, but also difficult to remember. If a user wants to visit this website, they need to spend extra time typing this domain name, which is not good for the long-term development of the brand. Avoid hyphens and numbers: Hyphens (such as “-\") and numbers usually make the domain name more complicated, which is not conducive to user memory and dissemination. Search engines also tend to give priority to domain names without hyphens, so it is recommended to avoid such characters as much as possible. Choose the right top-level domain name (TLD): Top-level domain names (such as .com, .org, .net, etc.) are an important factor affecting user trust. Although different TLDs have less impact on SEO, .com is generally considered more reliable and has global recognition.

To ensure that landing page names meet SEO requirements, the following standards need to be followed: Include target keywords: The page title and URL should try to include keywords that users may use when searching. This not only helps the page’s search engine ranking, but also ensures that the page matches the user’s search intent and improves the relevance of the page. For example, if your page is about “SEO Optimization Services”, the title should include “SEO Optimization Services” and the URL can be www.example.com/seo-optimization-services, which will help search engines identify the topic of the page. Attractiveness of title tags and descriptions: The title tag is the first thing that search engines read and is also the text displayed in search results. A clear and attractive title can significantly increase the click-through rate (CTR) of the page. At the same time, the title should not be too long, and it is generally recommended to be controlled within 50-60 characters so that it can be fully displayed in search results. Simple URL structure: Similar to page titles, URLs should be as concise and descriptive as possible. Ideally, URL structures should include target keywords and avoid using long numbers or meaningless parameters. For example, www.example.com/seo-tips is more SEO-friendly than www.example.com/page/1234. Highly consistent with content: Page names need to be highly consistent with the content of the page, and avoid using names that are irrelevant or inaccurate to the content. This not only helps search engines accurately index pages, but also improves user experience and engagement, and reduces bounce rates.

Avoid over-optimization: Although including keywords is a necessary condition for SEO, excessive keyword stacking (such as “best-seo-tips-for-your-website.com”) may be judged as keyword stacking by search engines, thus affecting rankings.

Cons: The generated domain name suggestions are usually simple and sometimes not very creative. The analysis of SEO is relatively basic and cannot provide traffic data or competition analysis.

The core of this process is keywords, and the keywords selected by advertisers will directly affect the exposure and click-through rate of ads. Google ads are mainly divided into two forms: search ads and display ads. Search ads usually appear at the top or bottom of the search results when users search for specific keywords, while display ads are displayed on various websites through images or videos.

Tacit knowledge, also known as implicit knowledge, is a type of knowledge that is difficult to formalize and personal, usually based on experience, intuition, and perception. Unlike explicit knowledge, tacit knowledge is difficult to convey through words, data, or formulas. It is often deeply embedded in an individual’s behavior, skills, or culture, and relies on practice and personal experience to acquire. For example, learning to ride a bicycle is a typical example of tacit knowledge. Although you can describe in words how to hold the handlebars, keep your balance, and pedal, these instructions cannot really convey how to keep your balance during actual riding. Only through repeated practice will you “understand” how to ride freely at a certain moment. Similarly, the skills of a craftsman and the handling of complex interpersonal relationships require long-term practice to master, rather than relying solely on written knowledge.

Explicit public knowledge: This kind of knowledge has been formalized, easy to spread and widely recognized. For example, textbooks, patents, laws and regulations, scientific papers, public industry standards, etc. are all explicit public knowledge. Example: Newton’s laws of mechanics in physics are explicit public knowledge because they can be found in textbooks and everyone can learn them. Implicit public knowledge: This type of knowledge is implicit but can be spread through specific social or learning occasions. For example, experience sharing or unwritten conventions in the industry can be acquired through participation in certain circles. Example: The working methods or culture within a certain industry, although not clearly defined, can be passed on through interactions in actual work.

Explicit private knowledge: This knowledge is explicit but is limited to individuals or small groups. It can be recorded, but it is usually not disclosed to the outside world, perhaps because of company secrets, proprietary technology or personal privacy. Example: A company’s R\u0026D plan or strategic documents, although documented, can only be circulated within the company due to confidentiality measures and cannot be obtained by the outside world. Implicit private knowledge: This type of knowledge is typical implicit knowledge, usually rooted in personal experience, technology or intuition, difficult to express through language or written form, and only belongs to an individual or a few people.

The competitive advantage it brings is more lasting, especially in professional fields. Limitations: Private tacit knowledge is difficult to transfer and share, which means it can only be spread within individuals or a small range and is difficult to scale. In addition, this knowledge may be lost as the holders leave (such as retirement or resignation). Private explicit knowledge This kind of knowledge is also of high value because it is explicit but still private and is usually only spread within a limited circle, such as internal corporate documents, proprietary technology, or patent-protected innovations. It is highly protective and can be regulated and applied. Limitations: Although explicit knowledge is easier to transfer, its proprietary value will decrease once it is made public or leaked. Therefore, companies need to protect this knowledge through legal means (such as intellectual property rights). Public tacit knowledge This type of knowledge is relatively valuable because, although it is implicit, it can still be shared through a certain socialization process, usually transmitted in the form of practice, interaction, or experience, such as a common craft or interpersonal interaction skills in an industry. Limitations: Since the transmission of tacit knowledge requires interaction and practice, it cannot be popularized on a large scale and requires time and practice accumulation to master, so the speed of dissemination is slow. Public explicit knowledge The lowest value, because this type of knowledge is open to everyone and can be easily obtained (such as textbooks, public patents, academic papers). Due to its popularity, its competitive value in the market is low. Limitations: Public explicit knowledge lacks uniqueness due to its universality and is difficult to provide competitive advantages. In addition, the decontextualization of knowledge may not fully meet specific needs in practical applications, and it needs to be combined with practical experience and context to be effectively applied.

SECI represents four modes of knowledge conversion, namely: Socialization, Externalization, Combination, Internalization. These processes describe the mutual transformation between implicit knowledge and explicit knowledge. Socialization – From implicit knowledge to explicit knowledge Socialization is the process of transferring implicit knowledge through interaction or observation. For example, in a master-apprentice relationship, the apprentice acquires skills by observing the actual operation of the master, similar to the knowledge acquired through practice and shared experience. This process is usually not dependent on language, but is achieved through joint action and sharing of experience. Example: New employees gradually master some operational skills that are difficult to describe in writing by working with old employees and observing how they solve problems. Externalization – From implicit knowledge to explicit knowledge Externalization is the process of converting implicit knowledge into explicit knowledge, usually through discussion, analogy, model and other means to formalize the experience, intuition or skills that are difficult for individuals to express into documents or theories. This is a key step in knowledge creation, because implicit knowledge can only be more widely disseminated after it becomes explicit knowledge. Example: An experienced technician passes on his years of implicit experience to other members of the team by writing technical documents or tutorials. Combination – From explicit knowledge to explicit knowledge Combination is the process of organizing and recombining different explicit knowledge to create new explicit knowledge. Through the integration and analysis of information, a new knowledge framework is established and disseminated through reports, databases, etc. Example: An organization collects research results from different departments, summarizes them and forms a new strategic plan or product development plan. Internalization – From explicit knowledge to implicit knowledge Internalization is to transform explicit knowledge into individual implicit knowledge by learning and practicing it. This step is similar to “experiential learning”, that is, individuals form their own understanding and experience through the practice of explicit knowledge, which becomes potential implicit knowledge. Example: Employees learn the organization’s training manuals and apply what they have learned in actual work, eventually forming their own operating methods and skills.

In an organization, this conversion process can promote knowledge creation and innovation. When implicit knowledge is passed on to others through socialization and externalized into explicit knowledge, and explicit knowledge is further absorbed through combination and internalization, new implicit and explicit knowledge can be generated. This knowledge conversion is the core of organizational knowledge management, especially in innovative enterprises, by effectively utilizing employees' implicit knowledge and converting it into explicit knowledge, it can bring continuous innovation and competitive advantages to the company. The SECI model can be visualized as a spiraling knowledge creation process, and the continuous conversion from implicit knowledge to explicit knowledge promotes the accumulation and development of knowledge.

The following will analyze in detail the cost structure of paid ranking advertising (PPC) and the difference between pay-per-click (CPC) and pay-per-impression (CPM). Cost structure of paid ranking advertising (PPC) Pay-per-click (PPC) is a core component of SEM. It allows advertisers to obtain ad placements by bidding in search engines. Here are a few key elements of the PPC cost structure: Bid: The bid that advertisers set for each keyword directly affects the ranking of their ads in search results. Generally, the higher the bid, the higher the ad will be displayed. In highly competitive industries, advertisers may need to set higher bids to ensure that their ads can get the desired exposure. Quality Score: This is a metric that search engines use to evaluate the quality of ads, which affects the ranking and cost per click (CPC) of ads. Quality scores are usually based on the relevance of the ad, the expected click-through rate (CTR), and the user experience of the landing page. High quality scores can not only reduce CPC, but also improve the ranking of ads. Level of Competition: Different keywords have different levels of competition. In popular industries, such as finance and travel, many advertisers are competing to bid, which may result in higher CPCs. In less popular fields, advertisers may only need to pay lower fees to get ad impressions. Daily Budget: The maximum daily expenditure set by advertisers controls the total cost of advertising. A reasonable daily budget can ensure that the ad is delivered steadily throughout the budget cycle, thereby maximizing exposure. The difference between CPC and CPM In SEM, advertisers can choose different billing models to meet different marketing goals. The two most common billing methods are CPC and CPM. The main difference between them lies in the billing method and applicable scenarios: CPC: In CPC mode, advertisers pay only when users actually click on the ad. This model is suitable for advertisers who want to get traffic and conversion directly, especially when they want to guide users to visit specific pages. The advantage of CPC is that advertisers can better control costs and ensure that each expenditure can bring actual traffic. CPM: In CPM mode, advertisers pay according to the number of times (Mille) the ad is displayed. CPM is suitable for advertisers who want to increase brand awareness and exposure, because even if there is no actual click, the display of the ad can increase the visibility of the brand. The advantage of CPM is that advertisers can achieve a wider audience coverage at a lower cost.

In some industries, specific keywords may be very popular and competitive, resulting in a significant increase in cost per click (CPC). For example, keywords in industries such as financial services, healthcare, and law are often very competitive because advertisers in these fields are willing to pay higher fees to get the attention of potential customers. Conversely, in less competitive industries or unpopular keywords, advertisers may only need to pay lower fees to achieve ad display. In addition, using long-tail keywords (i.e. keywords consisting of multiple words with relatively low search volume) can usually reduce advertising costs because they are relatively less competitive and advertisers usually bid significantly lower on such keywords than on popular keywords.

Different industries may have very different advertising expenditures and CPC levels due to differences in market demand and competitive situation. For example, the technology and e-commerce industries usually pay higher CPCs than traditional retail industries because they rely more on online traffic. Geographical factors are also important. In some high-consumption areas (such as large cities such as New York and London), advertisers may need to pay higher fees to place ads because the competition in the area is higher and the target audience is relatively concentrated. In more remote areas, advertisers may enjoy lower CPCs because there is relatively less competition.

This model is suitable for companies with stable budgets and continuous service needs, and can provide a certain degree of cost predictability. Commission: Some agencies will charge a certain percentage of commission based on the advertiser’s advertising expenditure. For example, the agency may charge a commission of 10% of advertising expenditure. The advantage of this model is that the agency’s revenue is closely related to the advertiser’s expenditure, and the agency is more motivated to optimize advertising performance to achieve a higher return on investment. Performance fee: In the performance fee model, the agency’s remuneration is directly linked to the advertising effect. For example, the agency may charge fees based on the number of conversions, sales, or other key performance indicators (KPIs) achieved. This model encourages agencies to continuously improve advertising effectiveness while also ensuring that advertisers' expenditures are consistent with actual results.

For example, “coffee machine” is a typical short-tail keyword. This type of keyword can attract a lot of traffic in SEO, but because they are too general, the competition is very fierce and it is difficult to accurately meet the user’s search intent. In addition, short-tail keywords may result in higher CPCs in SEM advertising because many competitors are competing for these popular keywords. On the other hand, Long-tail Keywords usually contain 3 to 5 words, with a more specific search scope, relatively small search volume, but high conversion rate. For example, “home automatic coffee machine recommendation” is a long-tail keyword. Due to the clear search intent, users who use long-tail keywords are usually in the final stage of purchase decision. Such keywords have less competition in SEO and are more likely to gain ranking advantages.

In SEO, branded keywords help increase the brand’s natural traffic, while in SEM, they can protect the brand from competitors' branded keyword bidding attacks through advertising. Non-branded keywords do not contain brand names, but describe a type of product, service or problem. For example, “high-quality coffee beans” is a non-branded keyword.

In SEO, transactional keywords can also be used on product pages or promotional content to attract users who are ready to buy. Informational Keywords are keywords used when users are seeking information, solutions, or knowledge. Common search terms include “how to”, “what is”, “guide”, etc. For example, “how to clean a coffee machine” is an informational keyword.

The following indicators are essential for evaluating the feasibility of keywords and their application in SEO and SEM. Search Volume Search volume refers to the average number of searches for a keyword in a certain period of time. This indicator can give you an idea of ​​the demand for a specific topic or product. Keywords with high search volume usually bring more traffic, but it also means more competition. In SEO, high-search volume keywords can help increase the exposure of the website, but be aware that these words are often highly competitive and not easy to rank quickly. Low-search volume long-tail keywords, although they have fewer searches, can bring more interested users due to their accuracy. In SEM, search volume is equally important. High-search volume keywords can help ads get more exposure opportunities, but if the budget is limited, you can consider choosing keywords with moderate search volume and relatively less competition to get a higher return on investment (ROI). Summary: Search volume is the basic measure of keyword potential. High-volume keywords help improve visibility, while low-volume long-tail keywords help target high-converting, accurate traffic. Keyword Difficulty Keyword Difficulty (also known as keyword competition) measures how difficult it is to rank for a keyword in search engines, usually based on the authority and content quality of other competing websites. Keywords with higher difficulty are usually occupied by big brands in the industry, and SEOs need to invest more resources to rank for these keywords. In SEO, keyword difficulty can help you decide which keywords to attack first. For new sites or sites with lower authority, choosing long-tail keywords with lower difficulty may be a more effective strategy because they have less competition and can bring higher ranking opportunities. In SEM, although keyword difficulty does not directly affect the display of ads, it is closely related to the cost per click (CPC) of ads - highly competitive keywords tend to have higher bids. Summary: Keyword difficulty determines the difficulty of ranking in SEO and also affects the intensity of ad bidding in SEM. Conversion Rate and Click-Through Rate (CTR \u0026 Conversion Rate) Click-Through Rate (CTR) indicates the proportion of ads or search results that are clicked, while Conversion Rate (Conversion Rate) measures how many clicks ultimately lead to the expected behavior (such as purchases, registrations, etc.). These two indicators are one of the core criteria for measuring keyword quality. In SEO, CTR is an important ranking factor. Search engines judge the relevance of a result to the search intent based on how often users click on a search result. Therefore, optimizing page titles and meta descriptions and increasing the click-through rate of keywords can indirectly improve search rankings. The conversion rate helps evaluate whether a keyword can bring valuable traffic - a high click-through rate but a low conversion rate may mean that the keyword attracts irrelevant traffic. In SEM, CTR and conversion rate are equally important. CTR affects the quality score of an ad, which in turn affects the ad placement and click cost. The conversion rate is the core of evaluating the return on investment of keywords, helping you optimize your advertising budget and invest more resources in high-conversion keywords. Summary: Keywords with high CTR and high conversion rates can bring more valuable traffic, and both SEO and SEM need to continuously optimize for these indicators. Competition intensity (natural competition vs paid competition) Competition intensity refers to the degree of competition for a keyword in natural search (SEO) and paid search (SEM).

Keyword classification has been discussed earlier, and this section will focus on how to actually apply these categories. 1. Matching user intent: informational keywords vs conversion keywords As we discussed earlier, keywords can be divided into two categories: informational and conversion. When choosing keywords, the most important thing is to match them according to the user’s search intent: Informational keywords: Suitable for users in the exploration stage, such as search terms such as “how to choose a coffee machine”. These keywords are usually suitable for SEO content strategies, and you can attract users' attention and improve page rankings by creating detailed guides, tutorials, or blog posts. Conversion keywords: These keywords are usually closer to the purchase decision stage and are suitable for SEM advertising. For example, words such as “buy a home coffee machine” or “coffee machine discounts” usually lead to direct conversions. Choosing conversion keywords can help increase the click-through rate (CTR) and conversion rate of ads. Summary: Matching keywords according to user search intent is the first priority in keyword selection. Informational keywords are suitable for content marketing in SEO, while conversion keywords are more effective in SEM advertising. 2. SEO: Keyword selection based on content type and user search intent In SEO, keyword selection should match the goals of the content and the needs of users: Long-tail keywords: These more specific and segmented keywords usually have lower search volumes, but because they are more accurate, they can attract specific target groups and bring high-quality traffic. For example, for the search term “beginner coffee machine recommendation”, you can attract users by creating a detailed product review or guide. Long-tail keywords are more suitable for long content such as blog posts and product reviews. Short-tail keywords: Short-tail keywords have higher search volumes, but competition is also very fierce. They are usually used for broad pages such as website homepages or product category pages. This type of keyword requires long-term optimization and is suitable for websites with greater demand for traffic and visibility. Content-keyword relevance: Make sure the selected keywords are closely related to the theme of the content. For example, if you are writing an article about a guide to choosing a coffee machine, using keywords like “coffee machine types” may improve the relevance and ranking of the article. On the contrary, using irrelevant keywords will affect SEO results. Summary: In SEO, keyword selection should be combined with user search intent and content type. Long-tail keywords are more suitable for attracting precise traffic, while short-tail keywords are suitable for increasing broad awareness. 3. SEM: Select high-conversion keywords based on advertising goals and budget In SEM advertising, the goal of keyword selection is to increase the click-through rate (CTR) and conversion rate (Conversion Rate) of the advertisement. Here are some optimization strategies: High-conversion keywords: When choosing keywords for paid advertising, conversion rate is the most critical factor. Choosing keywords that are directly related to user purchasing behavior, such as “buy coffee machine online” or “coffee machine discounts”, can improve the conversion effect of advertising. The conversion tracking function in Google Ads can help you understand which keywords bring the most conversions and focus your advertising budget on these high-efficiency words. Match type: Choose the appropriate keyword match type based on your advertising goals and budget. Broad match is suitable for advertising strategies with large budgets and the desire to reach a wider audience, but it may bring some inaccurate traffic.

It determines the layout of keywords on the page and the accuracy of advertisements. Different platforms and strategies have different requirements for keyword targeting. Below we will discuss in detail how to effectively locate keywords in SEO and SEM. 1. SEO: Layout of keywords in page structure, title, meta description, and URL In SEO, the reasonable layout of keywords can improve the search engine friendliness of the web page and help the web page rank higher in relevant searches. The following key positions need special attention in SEO optimization: Title Tag: The title tag is one of the most important SEO elements of a web page, which directly affects the display of the web page in search engine results. Make sure to put the core keywords in the first half of the title tag, which is beneficial to improve the relevance of the page and attract users to click. For example, if your keyword is “Best Coffee Machine”, then the title can be “Best Coffee Machine Recommendation: Most Popular Models in 2024”. Meta Description: Although the meta description itself does not directly affect the page ranking, it is crucial to improve the click-through rate (CTR). By cleverly embedding keywords in the meta description, you can enhance the attractiveness of the page and increase the possibility of users clicking. For example, “Looking to buy a coffee machine for home use? We have the best options for you in 2024.” URL: When optimizing the URL, make sure it is concise and contains the main keywords of the page. Search engines prefer to display URLs with clear structure and relevant content. For example, using a URL like example.com/best-coffee-machines can improve the ranking of the page in searches related to coffee machines. Page structure and content: Incorporate keywords into the natural flow of the content, while being careful to avoid overstuffing. You can distribute keywords at the beginning of paragraphs, headings (H1, H2, etc.) and conclusions, which can not only increase the weight of keywords but also do not affect the user experience. In addition, internal links and alt tags of images are also good places for keyword layout. Summary: Keyword targeting in SEO needs to focus on the reasonable layout of keywords in the page structure, ensuring that keywords can appear naturally in the title, meta description, URL and content to improve page relevance and user experience. 2. SEM: Keyword matching types (broad match, phrase match, exact match) and ad targeting strategies In SEM advertising, keyword targeting is closely related to the matching type of the ad. Different matching types can affect the accuracy and coverage of ad display. Common keyword matching types in Google Ads include broad match, phrase match and exact match, each of which is suitable for different advertising goals and budget strategies. Broad Match: This is the most relaxed matching type. Ads will be displayed in various searches related to the keyword, even if the user’s search terms are not completely matched. For example, if the keyword you choose is “coffee machine”, broad match may display ads in related searches such as “coffee pot” and “office coffee equipment”. Broad match can help you reach a wider user base, but it may reduce the accuracy of the ad. Therefore, it is more suitable for advertisers with larger budgets who want to increase brand exposure. Phrase Match: Phrase match requires that the user’s search terms contain your keyword phrase. The search results can include other words, but the order of the keyword phrases must be consistent. For example, when using phrase match “home coffee machine”, the ad may appear in searches such as “buy home coffee machine” or “best home coffee machine brand”. Phrase match provides greater control while maintaining a certain coverage, suitable for advertisers who want to balance precision and traffic. Exact Match: Exact m","date":"2024-10-01","objectID":"/posts/keyword-research-and-targeting/:4:3","tags":["SEM","SEO","Digital Marketing","Google Ads"],"title":"Practical skills for Keyword Research and Targeting","uri":"/posts/keyword-research-and-targeting/"},{"categories":["SEM","SEO","Digital Marketing"],"content":"How to find the best keywords for my website Finding the best keywords is a key step in optimizing SEO and SEM results.

By analyzing user behavior data, you can continuously optimize keyword strategies to ensure that your website can continue to attract high-quality traffic. Analyze website traffic data: Use tools such as Google Analytics to analyze which keywords bring traffic to the website, which pages have low bounce rates and long user stay time. With this data, you can identify which keywords are bringing you high-quality visits and adjust your keyword strategy based on actual user behavior. User search intent analysis: As user search habits change, search engines will continue to adjust their algorithms, so it is important to regularly check the types of keywords users use during the search process. You can view user queries through Google Search Console to understand how users find your page, and adjust content and keywords to better match their search intent. Use long-tail keywords to optimize content: By analyzing user behavior data, you may find that users prefer to find your website through more specific search terms. At this time, using long-tail keywords can help you accurately match user needs. Long-tail keywords usually have less competition, but the conversion rate they bring is often higher, so regularly adding or adjusting long-tail keywords to your content can bring you stable traffic. Page optimization and keyword position adjustment: User behavior data can also help you identify which pages or content perform better than other parts. Based on this data, you can adjust the position of keywords, such as putting efficient keywords in the title, subtitle, and beginning of the page content to improve the performance of the page in search results.

By regularly conducting A/B testing and conversion rate analysis, you can continuously optimize advertising keywords to improve advertising effectiveness and ROI. A/B test keywords: With A/B testing, you can test different keyword combinations within the same ad group to see which keywords bring more clicks or higher conversion rates. For example, you can test “coffee machine purchase” and “cheap coffee machine” as different keyword combinations to see which keyword combination brings better conversion results. Based on the test results, you can focus your budget on the better-performing keywords to improve the efficiency of advertising. Conversion rate analysis: Don’t just focus on clicks, but also analyze which keywords bring actual conversions. Using the conversion tracking feature in Google Ads, you can view the conversion rate of each keyword and optimize your ad group. By regularly analyzing conversion rates, you can find keywords that not only attract clicks, but also bring actual sales or other target conversions. Adjust match type: In SEM advertising, it is also important to choose the right keyword match type (broad match, phrase match, exact match). You can adjust the match type based on the results of the A/B test to see if certain keywords have a higher conversion rate under exact match, or if broad match brings more valuable traffic. Optimize keyword bids: By continuously monitoring ad performance, you can adjust bids based on keyword performance. For keywords with high conversion rates, consider increasing bids to increase display frequency and ad ranking. For keywords with poor performance, you can reduce budgets or suspend their use to avoid wasting advertising funds.

Thorough research The first step to writing a good SEM copy is thorough research and planning, including: Identify your unique selling proposition (USP) USP (Unique selling proposition) refers to the unique advantages of your product or service compared to your competitors. In this step, you need to identify the needs, pain points and preferences of your target users, analyze the user’s purchase decision process, and understand the factors they care about (such as price, quality, service, etc.). Method: Conduct market research and user interviews to obtain direct feedback. Create user portraits to depict the characteristics and behavior patterns of typical customers. Tools: SurveyMonkey or Google Forms: for designing and distributing online questionnaires. HubSpot Persona Generator: create detailed user portraits. Keyword research Keywords are words that users enter into search engines. Through effective keyword research, you can identify the user’s search intent and needs, thereby optimizing your copy and increasing the visibility and click-through rate of your ads. The most important thing in this step is to determine the user’s true search intent, that is, to understand the user’s goal when searching, whether to obtain information, compare products or purchase directly. At the same time, you need to determine the classification of keywords, including informational keywords, transactional keywords, etc. Method: Analyze relevant topics and questions that users may ask to help identify potential keywords. Observe social media and forums to understand the hot spots and concerns of user discussions. Use keyword tools to find related keywords and analyze the potential of each keyword. Focus on long-tail keywords, which usually have less competition and higher conversion rates. Tools: AnswerThePublic: Generate questions related to specific topics to help identify informational keywords. Google Trends: Analyze the search trends and popularity of keywords. Google Keyword Planner: Provides keyword search volume and competition to help formulate advertising strategies. SEMrush or Ahrefs: Analyze keyword rankings and traffic potential. Landing Page Consistency The landing page is the page that users visit after clicking on an ad. Ensuring that your ad copy is consistent with the content of the landing page to provide a consistent user experience is key to improving conversion rates. What the ad copy promises must be met on the landing page to avoid disappointment for users. Method: Compare ad copy and landing page content to ensure that key points and value propositions are consistent. Use similar titles and descriptions to enhance user trust. Tools: Grammarly: Check for consistency and grammatical errors in copy. Google Optimize: Test different versions of landing pages and observe conversion effects. Competitive SEM Copy Analysis Collect and study competitors' SEM copy, analyze their successes and shortcomings, find opportunities for improvement and differentiation, and develop more effective copy strategies. Method: Use your keywords in the search engine and observe the ads of top-ranked competitors. Save ad copy and screenshots for subsequent analysis. Compare your USP with competitor copy and identify areas for improvement. Tools: SWOT Analysis Tool: Helps you systematically evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of your competitors. SEMrush: View competitor advertising history and strategies. AdSpy: Analyze competitor ads on social media and search engines.

Start writing Before discussing more detailed writing techniques, it is important to make it clear that no matter what your product or service is, the core principle of SEM copywriting is: cater to the pain points of your target audience. Once you deviate from this principle, your ad conversion rate will definitely be negatively affected (even if the click-through rate is good). When writing SEM copy, the key is how to attract users and prompt them to take action. Let’s take an environmentally friendly water bottle as an example. This product not only solves the needs of users, but also has a sense of social responsibility. We will use several key elements to show how to write effective SEM copy so that it can not only capture the attention of the target audience but also increase conversion rates. Insert target keywords Naturally integrate relevant keywords into the copy to increase the search visibility and click-through rate of the ad. Suppose you sell environmentally friendly water bottles, the keywords can be “reusable water bottles” and “environmentally friendly water bottles”. Positive Example: Ad Title: “Eco-friendly water bottles, help you reduce plastic waste” Description: “Buy our reusable water bottles and enjoy 10% off! Keep drinking water healthy and save the planet!” Negative Example: Title: “Come here to buy water bottles!” Description: “We have a lot of choices!” (No keywords used) Through effective keyword insertion, users are more likely to find your ads when searching, increasing click-through rates, while negative examples may cause your ads to be ignored. Social Testimonials and Public Recommendations Use user reviews and testimonials to enhance the credibility of your ads. Social testimonials can help build trust with potential customers, especially in a competitive market. Customers who see positive feedback from other users are more likely to click on your ads and ultimately purchase. Positive Case: Quote real user reviews in ads, such as: “This water bottle has really changed my life. It is convenient and environmentally friendly! - Miss Zhang” Negative Case: “Our water bottle is very useful. Welcome to buy it!” (Lack of specific user feedback) The negative case lacks specific user recommendations, which may cause customers to doubt and be unwilling to buy. Strong and clear CTA (call to action) CTA is a key element to guide users to take action and must be concise and clear. A clear CTA can eliminate users' doubts and clearly tell them what to do next, thereby increasing conversion rates. Positive Case: Use a strong CTA in ads, such as: “Buy now and enjoy a limited-time 10% discount!” Negative Case: “Want to learn more?” (vague and unclear) The negative case does not clearly guide users to the next step, which may cause potential customers to feel confused and miss the opportunity to buy. Use numbers and statistics Numbers and statistics can effectively enhance the persuasiveness of copywriting. Specific numbers make the copy more authoritative, better able to attract users' attention and enhance their confidence in buying. Positive case: “90% of users reported that using our environmentally friendly water bottles reduced plastic use by 30%!” Negative case: “Our water bottles are very popular!” The lack of specific data in the negative case makes the ad unconvincing, and users may not be convinced, reducing their willingness to click and buy. Create a sense of urgency Motivate users to act quickly through time limits or scarcity. The sense of urgency can stimulate users' desire to buy, prevent them from delaying decisions, and increase conversion rates. Positive case: “Only 100 water bottles left, hurry up and buy! The event is limited to 48 hours!” Negative case: “We always have stock, welcome to buy!” The lack of urgency in the negative case may cause users to delay decision-making and miss the opportunity to buy. Use benefit-oriented language Emphasize the benefits that users can get, not just t","date":"2024-09-28","objectID":"/posts/create-sem-copy/:2:2","tags":["SEM","Digital Marketing","Google Ads"],"title":"Improve CTR \u0026 CVR: Master the Essential Skills of SEM Copy","uri":"/posts/create-sem-copy/"},{"categories":["SEM","Digital Marketing"],"content":"3. Test and Optimization A/B Test A/B test is an experimental method that compares two different versions of ad copy (version A and version B) at the same time to evaluate which version performs better, thereby improving the click-through rate (CTR) and conversion rate (CVR) of SEM copy. It includes the following steps: Clear goal: Determine the goal of the test, such as improving click-through rate or increasing purchase conversion. Select variables: Select specific elements to be tested, such as titles, descriptions, CTA, etc. Create two versions: Design version A and version B, and ensure that other conditions remain consistent for easy comparison. Randomly assign traffic: Randomly assign users to the two versions to ensure that each version receives the same amount of traffic. Collect data: Monitor the performance of each version and record key indicators such as click-through rate, conversion rate, etc. Analyze results: Evaluate which version performs better and make decisions based on data. Implement optimization: Select the best performing version and launch it in the ad, while considering continuing to test other variables. Some tools that can be used for SEM copy A/B testing: Google Optimize: A powerful tool for performing A/B testing, suitable for testing websites and ad copy. Optimizely: Provides a comprehensive A/B testing solution, easy to use, suitable for all types of companies. VWO (Visual Website Optimizer): Can perform A/B testing, split testing, etc., with a friendly interface, suitable for beginners. Adobe Target: An enterprise-level A/B testing tool suitable for large-scale advertising testing. Use ad extensions In SEM advertising, ad extensions are an important tool to enhance advertising effectiveness, providing additional information and interactive options, ultimately achieving higher conversion rates. Sitelink Add additional links to different parts of the website, such as product pages, customer reviews, or FAQs, to help users quickly find the information they need and increase the chance of clicking. For example: in an eco-friendly water bottle ad, add links to the pages of “Customer Reviews”, “Environmental Concepts”, and “Purchase Options”. Users can directly visit these links to learn more about the relevant information. Callout Add a short text to the ad to highlight the unique advantages of the product, such as “BPA-free”, “Free Shipping”, and “30-day Money Back Guarantee”, to enhance the attractiveness of the ad, provide more information that users care about, and encourage them to click on the ad. For example: In the eco-friendly water bottle ad text, include additional instructions such as “Eco-friendly Water Bottle, Free Shipping, 30-day Money Back Guarantee!” to make users feel the extra value. Structured Snippet Show specific features of a product or service, such as “color”, “brand”, “type”, etc. Provide users with key information to help them make faster choices during the decision-making process. For example: In an ad for an eco-friendly water bottle, use a structured snippet such as “Color: Blue, Green, Red” to help users quickly understand the available colors. Location extension Show the business address and provide a map link in the ad to help users find the physical store location, thereby increasing store traffic. This is especially effective for physical stores or service providers. Call extension Add a phone number to the ad so that users can call directly for consultation, making it easier for users to get more information and increase consultation and conversion rates. Price extension Show the price of a product or service in the ad to help users quickly understand the cost information. Improve price transparency and attract price-sensitive customers. For example: In an ad for an eco-friendly water bottle, displaying “Only $19.99” directly lets users know the price, thereby increasing their desire to buy.

Note that the name can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores, and must start with a letter. Then click “Confirm”: After that, enter the workflow editing page, and you can see that Coze will automatically generate the Start node and End node. On the left is the optional basic node mentioned above: First, we need to determine how to get the information we want from Google. In the past, we used to access the API directly by writing code to collect the information we need. In Coze, you can directly use plug-ins to complete this task. Click the “Plugin” button on the left, then select the Google Web Search plug-in and add it: The trigger of this workflow is the keyword entered by the user, so we need to configure a string type parameter in the Start node to receive the input text, named query here: The keyword information needs to flow to the Google Web Search plug-in, which completes the text processing and retrieval tasks. The operations here include: Set it to query in the previous step Connect the right side of the start node and the left side of the plug-in node to indicate the order between tasks In addition, we can also set two other parameters: num parameter: defines the maximum number of search results returned, the default is 10 start parameter: sets the number of pages to be searched, the default is 0, that is, the first page of search results At this time, we can first click “Test run” in the upper right corner to test the output effect. Here we input “chatgpt” as an example, and you can see that Coze took 3 seconds to successfully run this workflow. Click “Display result” in the upper right corner of the plug-in node to view the specific results of its processing task: I hope that the final output of this workflow includes: the title, description, and corresponding link of each search result. This information is mixed in the output results of the Google Web Search plug-in, so I need a Code node to extract this information. After placing the Code node between the plug-in node and the End node, set the input parameter to the output result of the plug-in node, and then click Edit in IDE to enter the code editing page: Currently, the Code node supports two languages ​​​​— Python and JavaScript. If you don’t know how to write code, you can also let the AI ​​write it for you by entering a natural language prompt in the built-in AI.

As the value of k increases, the size of each cluster generally decreases, and therefore the distance of each point to its cluster center decreases, resulting in a decrease in SSE. Find the “elbow point”: Ideally, we want to find a small k value while keeping the SSE relatively small. When we plot the SSE corresponding to different k values, as the k value increases, the decline rate of SSE will slow down, and the curve will show an “elbow” shape. This “elbow point” is often considered the optimal number of clusters, as adding more clusters after this point does not significantly improve model fit (i.e., decrease in SSE) Taking into account the impact of random initialization: The KMeans algorithm randomly selects k clustering centers at the beginning, which may cause the algorithm results to be affected by the initial selection, making the final clustering result somewhat random. In order to obtain consistent results across multiple runs or different environments, we can set a random state. Here, by setting random_state=123, we ensure that the initial random selection of cluster centers is the same every time we run KMeans, making the results reproducible.

Increase in cluster centers: When we increase the number of clusters k, it means that more cluster centers can be used to represent data points. As the number of cluster centers increases, each data point is more likely to be assigned to a cluster center that is closer to it, so the average distance of each point to its cluster center will decrease, resulting in lower SSE. Decrease in cluster size: As the k value increases, the number of data points contained in each cluster usually decreases. Smaller clusters make data points within the cluster closer, reducing the distance between data points and their cluster centers, further reducing SSE. Extreme cases: In extreme cases, if the value of k is equal to the total number of data points, then each data point is its own cluster center, and the SSE will be 0. But this situation has no actual clustering significance and just illustrates why SSE will continue to decrease as k increases. #Use the KMeans clustering algorithm and specify the maximum number of clusters to test as 10 #KElbowVisualizer will evaluate k values from 1 to 10 to decide which k value is the best choice #Call the fit method to train the KMeans model elbow = KElbowVisualizer(KMeans(random_state=123), k=10) elbow.fit(df_final_scaled) elbow.show() The result of the run is a graph of different k values (number of clusters) and the corresponding SSE (sum of squared errors). The purpose of the elbow plot is to help us visually see how the SSE changes as the value of k increases. Ideally, SSE decreases as the k value increases, but the rate of decrease will slow down significantly at a certain point. This point is the so-called “elbow point” and is considered the optimal number of clusters. As can be seen from the figure, the “elbow point” is k=5 #Based on the results in the above figure, create a clustering object and set the number of clusters to 5. That is, the ultimate goal is to divide the data points into 8 clusters. model = KMeans(n_clusters=5, random_state=123) #fit_predict uses the preprocessed and standardized data set to train (fit) the KMeans model and returns the cluster labels assigned to each data point. These labels are stored in the yhat variable yhat = model.fit_predict(df_final_scaled) #Add the clustering results to the original DataFrame, allowing you to see which cluster each original data point belongs to df['Cluster'] = yhat #Plot the number of occurrences of each cluster label sns.countplot(data=df, x='Cluster', palette='Blues') ","date":"2024-04-07","objectID":"/posts/customer-profiling-and-segmentation/:5:2","tags":["Python"],"title":"Customer Profiling \u0026 Segmentation with Python (Source code)","uri":"/posts/customer-profiling-and-segmentation/"},{"categories":["Python"],"content":"6.

View Width: The shape of the violin plot can reveal the characteristics of the data distribution. For example, if the violin plot is particularly wide at one end, it indicates that the data points are denser around that value. Analysis Box Plot: The embedded box plot provides a five-number summary of the data, helping us understand the distribution range of the data and the location of the median. Plot the kernel density estimate (KDE) of “age” and “total cost”: g = sns.FacetGrid(data=df, col='Cluster') g.map(sns.kdeplot, 'Age', 'Total_Spent', color='#95C8D8', fill=True) ","date":"2024-04-07","objectID":"/posts/customer-profiling-and-segmentation/:6:1","tags":["Python"],"title":"Customer Profiling \u0026 Segmentation with Python (Source code)","uri":"/posts/customer-profiling-and-segmentation/"},{"categories":["Python"],"content":"How to analyze the kernel density estimation chart The kernel density estimation plot (KDE plot) is a graph used to display the distribution of variables. It can be regarded as a smoothed version of the histogram. Through the KDE chart, we can intuitively understand the distribution of data, including the central tendency, dispersion and skewness of the data. Here are a few key points on how to interpret kernel density estimation plots: Peaks: The peaks on the KDE chart represent the mode area in the data, that is, there are more data points near this value. There can be multiple peaks on a plot, indicating that the data distribution may be multimodal (i.e., there are multiple modes). Width: The width of the graph reflects the variability or dispersion of the data. A kernel density plot with a larger width indicates that the data points are more dispersed; conversely, a plot with a narrower width indicates that the data points are more concentrated. Skewness: If the KDE plot is not completely symmetrical, the data distribution may be skewed. If the graph extends longer to the right, the data is positively skewed (right-skewed), that is, more data values are to the left of the mean; if the graph extends longer to the left, the data is negatively skewed (left-skewed), That is, more data values are to the right of the mean. Tails: The tail of the KDE plot can tell us the tail behavior of the data distribution, such as whether there is a long tail or extreme values. A long tail is when one end of the graph extends very far, indicating that there are some extreme high or low values. Overlay Plot: Sometimes, researchers will draw multiple KDE plots on the same graph to compare the data distribution of different subsets. At this time, you can understand the distribution differences between different subsets by observing which areas overlap more and the shape differences of each graph. Kernel density estimation and actual data: It should be noted that the kernel density estimation graph represents an estimate of the data distribution, not the actual data distribution. Therefore, it is useful for revealing overall trends in the data, but may not be suitable for precise statistical testing. Plot the kernel density estimates of “parent or not” and “total spent”: g = sns.FacetGrid(data=df, col='Cluster') g.map(sns.kdeplot, 'Is_Parent', 'Total_Spent', color='#95C8D8', fill=True) plt.text(0.6,3900, '0: Non Parent\\n1: Parent', weight='bold', fontsize=12) Plot the kernel density estimates of “number of children” and “total spent”: g = sns.FacetGrid(data=df, col='Cluster') g.map(sns.kdeplot, 'Kidhome', 'Total_Spent', color='#95C8D8', fill=True) Plot the kernel density estimates of “number of teenagers” and “total spent”: g = sns.FacetGrid(data=df, col='Cluster') g.map(sns.kdeplot, 'Teenhome', 'Total_Spent', color='#95C8D8', fill=True) Plot the kernel density estimates of “total children” and “total spent”: g = sns.FacetGrid(data=df, col='Cluster') g.map(sns.kdeplot, 'Total_Children', 'Total_Spent', color='#95C8D8', fill=True) Plot the kernel density estimates of “relationship status” and “total spent”: g = sns.FacetGrid(data=df, col='Cluster') g.map(sns.kdeplot, 'Living_With', 'Total_Spent', color='#95C8D8', fill=True) plt.text(0.7,3900, '0: Alone\\n1: Partner', weight='bold', fontsize=12) Draw a scatter plot of “education status” and “total spent”: g = sns.FacetGrid(data=df, col='Cluster') g.map(sns.scatterplot, 'Education', 'Total_Spent', color='#95C8D8') plt.text(0.6,3400, '0: Graduate\\n1: Postgraduate\\n2: Undergraduate', weight='bold', fontsize=12) ","date":"2024-04-07","objectID":"/posts/customer-profiling-and-segmentation/:6:2","tags":["Python"],"title":"Customer Profiling \u0026 Segmentation with Python (Source code)","uri":"/posts/customer-profiling-and-segmentation/"},{"categories":["Python"],"content":"How to analyze a scatter plot? Correlation Positive correlation: If an increase in one variable is accompanied by an increase in the other variable, then there is a positive correlation between the two variables. In a scatter plot, this appears as a general trend of the set of points from lower left to upper right. Negative correlation: If an increase in one variable is accompanied by a decrease in the other variable, then there is a negative correlation between the two variables. In a scatter plot, this appears as a general trend of the set of points from upper left to lower right. No correlation: If there is no obvious linear relationship between the two variables, the point set is relatively evenly distributed on the graph and there is no obvious trend. Clusters The points on a scatter plot sometimes form one or more clusters, indicating the presence of distinct subgroups in the data. These clusters may represent different categories, groups, or data points with similar characteristics. Outliers In a scatter plot, points that are far away from other data points are called outliers. These points may represent data entry errors, measurement errors, or actual data distribution properties. Trend Line Sometimes a trend line (such as a linear regression line) is added to a scatter plot to more clearly show the main trend between variables. The slope and direction of a trend line provide a visual representation of the relationship between variables. Distribution density In some scatter plots, the density of points reflects the concentration of data in that area. Areas with denser points indicate that there are more data points there.

These actions could include activities such as purchases made in a physical store, phone calls to a business, or in-person transactions. The process generally begins with a unique identifier, like a Google Click ID (GCLID) or a Facebook Pixel, being assigned to each visitor who clicks on an online ad. This identifier is then saved along with any lead information collected from the individual. Later, when the customer performs an action offline - for example, making a purchase in a brick-and-mortar store - this offline activity is matched with the saved online click ID. If a match is found, the offline conversion can be attributed to the specific online ad campaign that initially led the customer to the business. Offline conversion tracking provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of online marketing campaigns. It helps businesses understand how their online ads are driving real-world outcomes, enabling them to optimize their strategies for better targeting and increased conversion rates.

This involves obtaining accurate data from various sources such as physical stores, call centers, or sales teams, and then integrating this data with your online campaign information. The process can be complex and time-consuming, requiring robust systems and technical know-how. Attribution of Offline Conversions to Online Activities Connecting offline conversions to specific online activities can be difficult. For instance, if a customer clicks on an online ad but makes a purchase in a physical store, attributing this sale to the online ad is challenging. Tracking solutions like Google Click ID (GCLID) can help, but they require advanced setup and continuous management. Privacy and Compliance Issues With growing concerns about data privacy and increasingly stringent regulations, businesses need to ensure that their offline conversion tracking methods are compliant with laws such as GDPR and CCPA. This adds another layer of complexity to the process. Time Lag in Reporting Unlike online conversions that can be tracked in real-time, offline conversions often involve a time lag. This delay can make it harder to react quickly to trends and optimize campaigns effectively. Inaccuracies and Discrepancies Given the manual nature of data entry in many offline environments, there’s a higher risk of inaccuracies and discrepancies in offline conversion data. Ensuring data accuracy is crucial for reliable insights and effective decision-making. Resource Intensive Setting up and maintaining offline conversion tracking can be resource-intensive, requiring dedicated personnel and significant investment in tools and technology.

I have pushed new products, been in charge of high net worth products, experienced the whole account being blocked, and recently started to learn to recruit competent subordinates. Although the market situation is not optimistic in these years, from my personal experience, from the perspective of salary and market demand, overseas advertising specialist is still a good career choice.

In most cases, yes. Generally companies with overseas advertising specialist positions have the need to go overseas, so foreign language skills are a certain ability that will be assessed. Usually the requirement is at least IELTS 7 level (if you have relevant experience, you may be able to relax the requirement), some of the more demanding companies will ask you the specific grade 6 score, if it is just over the passing line, it may also be seen as a minus. For students majoring in minor languages, minor languages will be a plus for you, but you must also pass the English level. Will Google Ad Specialist be very busy? Do you need to work overtime a lot? If anyone has probably understood the position of overseas advertising specialist, they may have seen a lot of practitioners are discouraged to quit, citing “very serious overtime”, “no personal time”, “need to keep an eye on the account on holidays \" and so on. It must be admitted that overtime is a relatively common situation for this position, but it cannot be generalized. According to my own situation and the situation of related practitioners around me, whether overtime and the intensity of overtime will be affected by the following two factors: Party A \u0026 B Company There is also a distinction between A and B party companies for overseas advertising. Party A refers to companies that have self-developed products (games, software, physical products, etc.), and then hire specialized personnel to be responsible for overseas advertising of these products. A B-side company is a company that provides advertising management or consulting services for the A-side company, usually called an agency (advertising agency) in the industry. In the vast majority of cases, the overtime of Party B staff will be much more serious. Because Party A staff is responsible for the entire company’s product advertising accounts, while Party B staff usually have at least five clients' advertising accounts on hand, each client needs to promote a different number of products. I learned that one of the scarier figures is that there is an optimizer in Baidu who had more than 100 accounts in his hands. So, obviously, don’t go to a B-side company if you can find an A-side job. When screening jobs and companies, it is actually easy to see whether the job belongs to the A-side or B-side. In the job postings appear similar to the words “advertiser”, “advertisers”, is basically the position of the second party company. Promoted product types The more common types of products are: games, software, physical products (such as clothing, shoes and socks, accessories, etc.). For software and physical products, there will also be a distinction between C- and B-sides. Generally speaking, the overtime intensity is as follows (look at toB or toC first, then product type) C-side \u003e B-side Game \u003e physical product (partial e-commerce) \u003e software (non-game type) The size and magnitude of change of advertising traffic and the degree of market competition determine the frequency and intensity of your overtime. In addition, by the way, the overtime intensity of Google ad specialists is usually not as strong as that of Facebook ad specialists, because the algorithm mechanism of the two platforms is different, the latter has higher requirements for data continuity, and due to the existence of time differences, it usually requires the specialists to get up in the middle of the night to see if the account is abnormal. Is the Google Ad Specialist only responsible for Google channels? Can the experience be applied to other platforms? Google Ads specialists are usually only responsible for Google channels, but some smaller companies may have one specialist responsible for multiple channels (e.g. Facebook, Tiktok, Instagram, etc.). Regarding whether the experience can be reused, it needs to be judged according to different platform placement and algorithm mec","date":"2023-01-26","objectID":"/posts/what-does-a-google-ads-specialist-do/:2:0","tags":["SEM","Google Ads","Digital Marketing"],"title":"What does a Google Ads Specialist do?","uri":"/posts/what-does-a-google-ads-specialist-do/"},{"categories":["SEM","Digital Marketing"],"content":"Job Description The daily work of Google Ads Specialist includes the following.
